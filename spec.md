## Overview
Events are everywhere. However, event publishers tend to describe events
differently.

The lack of a common way of describing events means developers are constantly
re-learning how to receive events. This also limits the potential for libraries,
tooling and infrastructure to aide the delivery of event data across
environments, like SDKs, event routers or tracing systems. The portability
and productivity that can be achieved from event data is hindered overall.

Enter CloudEvents, a specification for describing event data in a common way.
CloudEvents seeks to ease event declaration and delivery across services,
platforms and beyond.

# Design Goals

CloudEvents are typically used in a distributed system to allow for services to
be loosely coupled during development, then may be configured with
tight-coupling for specific applications or dynamically configured at runtime.

The goal of the CloudEvents specification is to define interoperability of event
systems that allow cloud providers, third-party tools and services to provide:
- new event sources
- new event consumers
- observability, such as monitoring, debugging and visualization,
- developer tools and libraries

## Key properties of the system:
- Source & action may be developed and deployed independently
- Trigger configuration allows for actions to be invoked based on a condition
(e.g. for a specific event type generated by a source, optionally filtered by
specific attribute values, such as a Function which is invoked when an image is
uploaded to specific S3 or Google Cloud Storage “bucket” path)
- Events are uniquely identified to facilitate developer velocity and tooling:
  - a unique idenfier allows for idempotency for reliable implementation
  - structured event definitions allow the consumer to rely on a specific format
- Common metadata attributes allow for observability via tools whithout
knowledge of the specific implementation of an event system and also can provide
value without detailed handling of the specifics of the unique event data
- CloudEvents may be transported from source to action with different protocols.

In order to achieve the above goals and desired system properties, the
Serverless WG must agree on a common vocabulary with precise definitions
describing the key elements of the system including:
- [Source](../spec.md#source)
- Action: An action consumes an event, producing a behavior or effect which was
triggered by a specific *occurrence* from a specific *source*.  While the
details of how events are delivered to an action is outside of the scope of the
specification, the purpose of generating an *event* is typcially to allow other
systems to easily react to changes in a source that they do not control. The
*source* and action are often built by different developers.

Examples:
- the *source* is a managed service and the *action* is custom
code in a serverless Function (such as AWS Lambda or Google Cloud Functions).
- the *source* is an IoT device and the *event* is transmitted through an API
Gateway to the *action*, a service provided by a different developer.

The events system provides a way for the developer to specify which *event*
should be delivered to which *action*. The specific mechanism is outside the
scope of the specification, yet the following definitions faciltate an
understanding of how CloudEvent are typically used in context:
- Trigger: the condition that causes an event to be transmitted from source to
action
- Rule: the association of trigger + action

Systems which generate events can have independent mechanisms for how triggers
are specified and how rules are stored and evaluated.

## Status
At this time the specification is focused on the following scope:

* Agree upon a set of event metadata attributes (“context”) that:
  * Offer a basic description of the event and the data it carries.
  * Are currently implemented and semantically similar across multiple
    platforms.
  * Can be delivered separately from the event data in the transport headers
    (e.g. HTTP, AMQP, Kafka) or together with the data in a serialized fashion
    (e.g. JSON, protobuf, Avro).
  * Include a description of the transport/protocol and encoding, with an
    initial focus on HTTP.
  * Can be extended to support experimental or uncommon features, while being
    clearly indicated as an extension (e.g. extensions use a common prefix).
  * Allow for evolution of both the payload and CloudEvents definition (e.g.
    versioning).
  * Can be embedded at different stages along the route of the event by
    middleware (e.g. a router can add transport or auth information).
* Establish a backlog of prospective event metadata attributes (“context”)
  for potential inclusion in the future.
* Include use-case examples to help users understand the value of CloudEvents,
  with an initial focus on HTTP and Functions-as-a-Service/Serverless computing.
* Determine process and overall governance of the specification.
* Discuss additional architecture components that complement this specification.

## Notations and Terminology

### Notational Conventions

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD",
"SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to
be interpreted as described in [RFC 2119](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2119).

### Terminology

This specification defines the following terms:

#### Occurrence
An "occurrence" is the capture of a statement of fact during the operation of
a software system. This might occur because of a signal raised by the system or
a signal being observed by the system, because of a state change, because of
a timer elapsing, or any other noteworthy activity. For example, a device might
go into an alert state because the battery is low, or a virtual machine is
about to perform a scheduled reboot.

#### Event
Data representing an occurrence, a change in state, that something happened
(or did not happen).  Events include context and data.  Each occurrence MAY be
uniquely identified with data in the event. Events ought not to be confused
with messages which are used to transport or distribute data without assumptions
regarding its semantic. Events are considered to be facts that have no given
destination. Events are used to notify other systems that something has
happened.

#### Context
A set of consistent metadata attributes included with the event about the
occurrence that tools and developers can rely upon to better handle the event.
These attributes describe the event and the structure of its data, include
information about the originating system, and more.

#### Message
Events are transported from a source to a destination via messages.

#### Data
Domain-specific information about the occurrence (i.e. the payload). This
might include information about the occurrence, details about the data
that was changed, or more.

#### Protocol
Messages can be delivered through various industry standard protocol (e.g. HTTP,
AMQP, MQTT, SMTP), open-source protocols (e.g. Kafka, NATS), or
platform/vendor specific protocols (AWS Kinesis, Azure Event Grid).


## Context Attributes
Every event conforming to this specification MUST include a context.

Context is designed such that it can be delivered separately from the event
data (e.g. in protocol headers or protocol specific attributes). This allows
the context to be inspected at the destination without having to deserialize
the event data. The context might also need to be serialized with the event
data for some use cases (e.g. a JSON implementation might use one JSON object
that contains both context and data).

### namespace
* Type: String
* Description: Identifier that uniquely identifies the organization publishing
  the event.
* Constraints:
  * REQUIRED
  * MUST be a non-empty string
* Examples:
  * kafka.apache.org
  * com.microsoft.azure

### event-type
* Type: String
* Description: Type of the event `data`. Producers can specify the format of
  this, depending on their service. This enables the interpretation of `data`,
  and can be used for routing, policy and more.
* Constraints:
  * REQUIRED
  * MUST be a non-empty string
* Examples:
  * customer.created

### event-type-version
* Type: String
* Description: The version of the `event-type`. This enables the interpretation
  of `data` by eventual consumers, requires the consumer to be knowledgeable
  about the producer.
* Constraints:
  * OPTIONAL
  * If present, MUST be a non-empty string

### cloud-events-version
* Type: String
* Description: The version of the CloudEvents specification which the event
  uses. This enables the interpretation of the context.
* Constraints:
  * REQUIRED
  * MUST be a non-empty string

### source
* Type: Object
* Description: This describes the software instance that emits the event at
  runtime (i.e. the producer). It contains sub-properties (listed below)
* Constraints:
  * REQUIRED
  * MUST contain at least one non-empty sub-property.

### source-type
* Type: String
* Description: Type of the event source. Providers define list of event
  sources.
* Constraints:
  * REQUIRED
  * MUST be a non-empty string
* Examples:
  * s3

### source-id
* Type: String
* Description: ID of the event source.
* Constraints:
  * REQUIRED
  * MUST be a non-empty string
* Examples:
  * my.s3.bucket

### event-id
* Type: String
* Description: ID of the event. The semantics of this string are explicitly
  undefined to ease the implementation of producers. Enables deduplication.
* Examples:
  * A database commit ID
* Constraints:
  * REQUIRED
  * MUST be a non-empty string
  * MUST be unique within the scope of the producer

### event-time
* Type: Timestamp per [RFC 3339](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3339)
* Description: Timestamp of when the event happened.
* Constraints:
  * OPTIONAL
  * If present, MUST adhere to the format specified in
    [RFC 3339](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3339)

### schema-url
* Type: URI per [RFC 3986](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3986)
* Description: A link to the schema that the `data` attribute adheres to.
* Constraints:
  * OPTIONAL

### extensions
* Type: Map <String, Object>
* Description: This is for additional metadata and this does not have a
  mandated structure. This enables a place for custom fields a producer or
  middleware might want to include and provides a place to test metadata before
  adding them to the CloudEvents specification. TBD - Determine a shorter
  prefix for this (e.g. OpenAPI uses “x-”)
* Constraints:
  * OPTIONAL
  * If present, MUST contain at least one entry
* Examples:
  * authorization data

### data
* Type: Arbitrary payload
* Description: The event payload. The payload depends on the event-type,
  schema-url and event-type-version, the payload is encoded into a media format
  which is specified by the content-type attribute (e.g. application/json).
* Constraints:
  * OPTIONAL


## Additional Topics & Questions

* Context Attribute Names - We decided not to spend too much time on property
  names during our working sessions. Instead the focus has been on semantics.
  We still need to revise property names.
* Event Consumer API - What does this look like?
* Routing, Batching, Failure Semantics - What do these look like?
* Authentication - Will this be included within the event?
  * Initial authN (e.g. auth at the point of event occurrence)
  * Transport level authN (e.g. auth on the event)
* What is the best way to handle encoding for event payloads?
* How to specify an action that is desired to happen based on an event
  notification (also does this violate our interpretation of events)?
* Micro batch considerations – For various streaming and asynchronous
  implementations the client might push one event at a time, but the function
  might want to process multiple events per invocation and obtain higher
  efficiency. There needs to be a mechanism to trigger a function with an
  array of events. An example implementation can be to indicate in the event
  type that it's a list type and pass a “records” list object where each
  record holds its own headers, body or attributes.
* Event Routing – Once the event structure, protocol, and API are well defined
  it becomes trivial to route from one type to another, or even route internal
  events to external clouds. It can be accomplished by simply writing a
  serverless function which listens on the source event, opens a connection to
  the destination protocol and maps every incoming event (received through
  event API) to an event message over the destination protocol.
