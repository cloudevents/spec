## Overview
Events are everywhere. However, event publishers tend to describe events
differently.

The lack of a common way of describing events means developers are constantly
re-learning how to receive events. This also limits the potential for libraries,
tooling and infrastructure to aide the delivery of event data across
environments, like SDKs, event routers or tracing systems. The portability
and productivity that can be achieved from event data is hindered overall.

Enter CloudEvents, a specification for describing event data in a common way.
CloudEvents seeks to ease event declaration and delivery across services,
platforms and beyond.

## Status
At this time the specification is focused on the following scope:

* Agree upon a set of event metadata attributes (“context”) that:
  * Offer a basic description of the event and the data it carries.
  * Are currently implemented and semantically similar across multiple
    platforms.
  * Can be delivered separately from the event data in the transport headers
    (e.g. HTTP, AMQP, Kafka) or together with the data in a serialized fashion
    (e.g. JSON, protobuf, Avro).
  * Include a description of the transport/protocol and encoding, with an
    initial focus on HTTP.
  * Can be extended to support experimental or uncommon features, while being
    clearly indicated as an extension (e.g. extensions use a common prefix).
  * Allow for evolution of both the payload and CloudEvents definition (e.g.
    versioning).
  * Can be embedded at different stages along the route of the event by
    middleware (e.g. a router can add transport or auth information).
* Establish a backlog of prospective event metadata attributes (“context”)
  for potential inclusion in the future.
* Include use-case examples to help users understand the value of CloudEvents,
  with an initial focus on HTTP and Functions-as-a-Service/Serverless computing.
* Determine process and overall governance of the specification.
* Discuss additional architecture components that complement this specification.

## Notations and Terminology

### Notational Conventions

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD",
"SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to
be interpreted as described in [RFC 2119](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2119).

### Terminology

This specification defines the following terms:

#### Occurrence
When something happens (or doesn’t happen) and is detected by a software
system. This is most typically when that system receives an external signal
(e.g. HTTP or RPC), though could also be through observing a changing value
(e.g. an IoT sensor or period of inactivity).

#### Event
Data representing an occurrence, a change in state, that something happened
(or did not happen).  Events include context and data.  Each occurrence MAY be
uniquely identified with data in the event. Events ought not to be confused
with messages which are used to transport or distribute data without assumptions
regarding its semantic. Events are considered to be facts that have no given
destination. Events are used to notify other systems that something has happened.

#### Context
A set of consistent metadata attributes included with the event about the
occurrence that tools and developers can rely upon to better handle the event.
These attributes describe the event and the structure of its data, include
information about the originating system, and more.

#### Message
Events are transported from a source to a destination via messages.

#### Data
Domain-specific information about the occurrence (i.e. the payload). This
might include information about the occurrence, details about the data
that was changed, or more.

#### Protocol
Messages can be delivered through various industry standard protocol (e.g. HTTP,
AMQP, MQTT, SMTP), open-source protocols (e.g. Kafka, NATS), or
platform/vendor specific protocols (AWS Kinesis, Azure Event Grid).


## Context Attributes
Every event conforming to this specification MUST include a context.

Context is designed such that it can be delivered separately from the event
data (e.g. in protocol headers or protocol specific attributes). This allows
the context to be inspected at the destination without having to deserialize
the event data. The context might also need to be serialized with the event
data for some use cases (e.g. a JSON implementation might use one JSON object
that contains both context and data).

### namespace
* Type: String
* Description: Identifier that uniquely identifies the organization publishing
  the event.
* Constraints:
  * REQUIRED
  * MUST be a non-empty string
* Examples:
  * kafka.apache.org
  * com.microsoft.azure

### event-type
* Type: String
* Description: Type of the event `data`. Producers can specify the format of
  this, depending on their service. This enables the interpretation of `data`,
  and can be used for routing, policy and more.
* Constraints:
  * REQUIRED
  * MUST be a non-empty string
* Examples:
  * customer.created

### event-type-version
* Type: String
* Description: The version of the `event-type`. This enables the interpretation
  of `data` by eventual consumers, requires the consumer to be knowledgeable
  about the producer.
* Constraints:
  * OPTIONAL
  * If present, MUST be a non-empty string

### cloud-events-version
* Type: String
* Description: The version of the CloudEvents specification which the event
  uses. This enables the interpretation of the context.
* Constraints:
  * REQUIRED
  * MUST be a non-empty string

### source
* Type: Object
* Description: This describes the software instance that emits the event at
  runtime (i.e. the producer). It contains sub-properties (listed below)
* Constraints:
  * REQUIRED
  * MUST contain at least one non-empty sub-property.

### source-type
* Type: String
* Description: Type of the event source. Providers define list of event
  sources.
* Constraints:
  * REQUIRED
  * MUST be a non-empty string
* Examples:
  * s3

### source-id
* Type: String
* Description: ID of the event source.
* Constraints:
  * REQUIRED
  * MUST be a non-empty string
* Examples:
  * my.s3.bucket

### event-id
* Type: String
* Description: ID of the event. The semantics of this string are explicitly
  undefined to ease the implementation of producers. Enables deduplication.
* Examples:
  * A database commit ID
* Constraints:
  * REQUIRED
  * MUST be a non-empty string
  * MUST be unique within the scope of the producer

### event-time
* Type: Timestamp per [RFC 3339](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3339)
* Description: Timestamp of when the event happened.
* Constraints:
  * OPTIONAL
  * If present, MUST adhere to the format specified in
    [RFC 3339](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3339)

### schema-url
* Type: URI per [RFC 3986](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3986)
* Description: A link to the schema that the `data` attribute adheres to.
* Constraints:
  * OPTIONAL
  * If present, MUST adhere to the format specified in
    [RFC 3986](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3986)

### extensions
* Type: Map <String, Object>
* Description: This is for additional metadata and this does not have a
  mandated structure. This enables a place for custom fields a producer or
  middleware might want to include and provides a place to test metadata before
  adding them to the CloudEvents specification. TBD - Determine a shorter
  prefix for this (e.g. OpenAPI uses “x-”)
* Constraints:
  * OPTIONAL
  * If present, MUST contain at least one entry
* Examples:
  * authorization data
  * content type

### data
* Type: Arbitrary payload
* Description: The event payload. The payload depends on the event-type,
  schema-url and event-type-version.
* Constraints:
  * OPTIONAL


## Additional Topics & Questions

* Context Attribute Names - We decided not to spend too much time on property
  names during our working sessions. Instead the focus has been on semantics.
  We still need to revise property names.
* Event Consumer API - What does this look like?
* Routing, Batching, Failure Semantics - What do these look like?
* Authentication - Will this be included within the event?
  * Initial authN (e.g. auth at the point of event occurrence)
  * Transport level authN (e.g. auth on the event)
* What is the best way to handle encoding for event payloads?
* How to specify an action that is desired to happen based on an event
  notification (also does this violate our interpretation of events)?
* Micro batch considerations – For various streaming and asynchronous
  implementations the client might push one event at a time, but the function
  might want to process multiple events per invocation and obtain higher
  efficiency. There needs to be a mechanism to trigger a function with an
  array of events. An example implementation can be to indicate in the event
  type that it's a list type and pass a “records” list object where each
  record holds its own headers, body or attributes.
* Event Routing – Once the event structure, protocol, and API are well defined
  it becomes trivial to route from one type to another, or even route internal
  events to external clouds. It can be accomplished by simply writing a
  serverless function which listens on the source event, opens a connection to
  the destination protocol and maps every incoming event (received through
  event API) to an event message over the destination protocol.
