## Overview

Message Endpoints provide a location from which Message producers and consumers
can share Messages. Endpoints could act as either consumers or producers
of Messages, and the mechanisms by which those Messages are transferred
might vary.

This specification defines a set of APIs, and related documents, that allow
for the discovery of these Endpoints and their related metadata. This
information can then be used to perform actions such as:
- Subscribing for Messages
- Pushing or Pulling of Messages with the Endpoint
- Generating of Message validation code based on the schema associated with
  a Message Definition

While the specification is written in term of "messaging", it applies equally
to "eventing" since it can be considered as subset of messaging.

## Notations and Terminology

### Notational Conventions

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD",
"SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be
interpreted as described in [RFC 2119](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2119).

In the pseudo JSON format snippets `?` means the preceding property is
OPTIONAL, `*` means the preceding property MAY appear zero or more times, and
`+` means the preceding property MUST appear at least once.

### Terminology

This specification defines the following terms:

#### Discovery Service

A compliant implementation of this specification that advertises the set of
Endpoints, Groups, Definitions and other metadata to aid in the programmic
interactions with the Endpoints.

### Conventions

#### References

Within the data model defined by this specification there are properties
that represent references to Discovery resources. Despite these properties
being simple URIs to the targeted resource, their values will be serialized as
Objects with a nested property name `uri` whose value will be the URI to the
resource. For example:
```
{ "uri": "https://example.com/discovery/endpoints/123" }
```

They are serialized as Objects so that query results MAY include additional
properties of the targeted resource as siblings to the `uri` property.
Implementation MAY include ANY of the properties of the resource except the
`self` property (more on this below). For example:
```
{ "uri": "https://example.com/discovery/endpoints/123", "name": "MyService" }
```

This allows for requestors to have some additional information about the
target resource without the need to perform any additional queries. This
is most commonly used for user-interfaces that wish to display some meaningful
information about the resource instead of just its URI. It is RECOMMENDED that
references include at least the `name` property.

During serialization of these references, typically due to the inclusion of an
`inline` type of flag on a query, an implementation MAY choose to replace these
Object references with a full Object serialization of the targeted resource.
As such, it might be ambiguous as to whether the Object is just a reference or
the full inlined resource.  To address this, each full serialization of a
resource MUST include the `self` property of the resource but MUST NOT
include the `uri` property defined above, since it is no longer a "reference".

With these rules, the presence of `self` or `uri` can be used to determine
if the serialized Object is a reference or a full serialization of a resource.

## Resource Model

This section defines the resource model of a Discovery Service.

### Common Resource Properties

All resources defined by this specifation have the following common properties
defined:

#### id

- Type: String
- Description: A unique identifier for the resource.
- Constraints:
  - REQUIRED
  - MUST be a non-empty String
  - MUST conform with
    [RFC3986/3.3](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc3986#section-3.3)
    `segment-nz-nc` syntax
  - MUST be unique across all instances of the this resource type within the
    the current Discovery Service.
- Examples:
  - A UUID
  - `1234`

#### name

- Type: String
- Description: The name of the resource.
- Constraints:
  - REQUIRED
  - MUST be a non-empty string
- Examples:
  - `My Queue`
  - `Blob Store Events`
  - `Blob Delete`

#### self

- Type: URI
- Description: A unique URI for the resource. The URI MUST be a combination
  of the base URI of the list of this resource type for the current Discovery
  Service appended with the `id` of this resource.
- Constraints:
  - REQUIRED
  - MUST be a non-empty URI
- Examples:
  - `https://example.com/discovery/endpoints/1234`
  - `https://example.com/discovery/groups/234`
  - `https://example.com/discovery/definitions/569`

#### epoch

- Type: Unsigned Integer
- Description: A number representing the version number of the resource. Each
  time the resource is modified this property MUST be updated with a new value
  that is greater than the current one.
- Constraints:
  - REQUIRED
  - MUST be an unsigned integer
- Examples:
  - `0`
  - `1001`

#### origin

- Type: URI
- Description: A URI reference to the original source of this resource. This
  can be used to locate the true authority owner of the resource in cases of
  distributed Discovery Services. If this property is absent its default value
  is the value of the `self` property and in those cases its presence in the
  serialization of the resource is OPTIONAL.
- Constraints:
  - OPTIONAL if this Discovery Service is the authority owner
  - REQUIRED if this Discovery Service is not the authority owner
  - if present, MUST be a non-empty URI
- Examples:
  - `https://example2.com/discovery/endpoints/9876`

#### description

- Type: String
- Description: A summary of the purpose of the resource.
- Constraints:
  - OPTIONAL
  - if present, MUST be a non-empty string
- Examples:
  - "A queue of the sensor generated messages"

#### tags

- Type: Map of name/value string pairs
- Description: A mechanism in which additional metadata about the resource can
  be stored.

  When this property has no value it MUST either be serialized as an empty
  map or excluded from the serialization entirely.
- Constraints:
  - OPTIONAL
  - if present, MUST be a map of name/value string pairs
  - Each name MUST be a non-empty, unique within the scope of this map, string.
    Values MAY be empty strings
- Examples:
  - `{ "owner": "John", "verified": "" }`

#### docs

- Type: URI-reference
- Description: A URI-reference to additional documentation about this resource.
  This specification does not define any constraints on the data returned from
  this URI-reference.
- Constraints:
  - OPTIONAL
  - if present, MUST be a non-empty URI-reference
  - if present with a schema, it MUST use either `http` or `https`
- Examples:
  - `https://example.com/docs/myQueue`

### Endpoint

An Endpoint is ...

The following pseudo JSON shows the basic defintion of an Endpoint:
```
{
    "id": "URI-reference",
    "name": "STRING",
    "self": "URI",
    "epoch": UINT,
    "origin": "URI" ?
    "description": "STRING", ?
    "tags": { "STRING": "STRING", ... } ?
    "docs": "URL", ?

    "deprecated": { ... }, ?
    "channel", "STRING", ?
    "authscope": "URI", ?

    "usage": "subscriber|consumer|producer",
    "config": {
        "protocol": "STRING",
        "endpoints": "URL" | [ "URL", ... ],
        "options": { ... }, ?
        "strict": true|false, ?
    }, ?

    "groups": [ GROUP-reference, ... ], ?
    "definitions": [ DEFINITION-reference, ... ] ?
}

```

The following Endpoint properties are defined:

#### id

See [Common Resource Properties](#common-resource-properties).

#### name

See [Common Resource Properties](#common-resource-properties).

#### self

See [Common Resource Properties](#common-resource-properties).

#### epoch

See [Common Resource Properties](#common-resource-properties).

#### origin

See [Common Resource Properties](#common-resource-properties).

#### description

See [Common Resource Properties](#common-resource-properties).

#### tags

See [Common Resource Properties](#common-resource-properties).

#### docs

See [Common Resource Properties](#common-resource-properties).

#### deprecated

- Type: Object container the following properties:
  - effective<br>
    An OPTIONAL property indicating the time when the Endpoint entered, or will
    enter, a deprecated state. The date MAY be in the past or future.
    If present, this MUST be an [RFC3339][rfc3339] timestamp.

  - removal<br>
    An OPTIONAL property indicating the time when the Endpoint MAY be removed.
    The Endpoint MUST NOT be deleted before this time. If this property is not
    present then client can not make any assumption as to when the Endpoint
    might be removed. Note: as with most Endpoint properties, this property
    is mutable. If present, this MUST be an [RFC3339][rfc3339] timestamp.

  - alternative<br>
    An OPTIONAL property specifying the URL to an alternative Endpoint the
    client can consider as a replacement for this Endpoint. There is no
    guarantee that the referenced Endpoint is an exact replacement, rather the
    client is expected to investigate the Endpoint to determine if it is
    appropriate.

  - docs<br>
    An OPTIONAL property specifying the URL to additional information about
    the deprecation of the Endpoint. This specification does not mandate any
    particular format or information, however some possibilities include:
    reasons for the deprecation or additional information about likely
    alternative Endpoints.

- Description: Presence of this property (even without any nested properties)
  indicates that the Endpoint is, or will be, deprecated and will be removed at
  some point in the future.

  This specification makes no statement as to whether any existing subscription
  will still be valid and usable after this date. However, it is expected that
  new subscription requests after the Endpoint is deleted will likely be
  rejected.

  Note that an implementation is not mandated to use this attribute in
  advance of removing an Endpoint, but is it RECOMMENDED that they do so.
- Constraints:
  - OPTIONAL
- Examples:
  - `"deprecated": {}`
  - ```
    "deprecated": {
      "removaltime": "2030-12-19T00:00:00-00:00",
      "alternative": "https://discovery.example.com/services/123"
    }
    ````

#### channel

- Type: String
- Description: A string that can be used to correlate Endpoints. Any Endpoints
  within an instance of a Discovery Service that share the same `channel`
  non-empty value MUST have some relationship. This specification does not
  define that relationship or the specific values used in this property.

  When this property has no value it MUST either be serialized as an empty
  string or excluded from the serialization entirely.
- Constraints:
  - OPTIONAL
  - if present, MUST be a string
- Examples:
  - `queue1`

#### authscope

- Type: TBD
- Description: TBD
- Constraints:
  - OPTIONAL
- Examples:
  - TBD

#### usage

- Type: String
- Description: The interaction model supported by this Endpoint. This
  specification defines a set of possible values (see the
  [Usage Values](#usage-values) section for more information, however,
  implementations MAY define new values as extensions. It is RECOMMENDED
  that extension values be defined with some organizational unique string
  to reduce the chances of collisions with possible future spec-defined values.
- Constraints:
  - REQUIRED
  - MUST be a non-empty string
- Examples:
  - `consumer`

#### config

- Type: Object
- Description: Metadata the provides additional information concerning the
  interactions with this Endpoint. Each `usage` value MUST define the set of
  `config` properties that are valid.

  When this property has no value it MUST either be serialized as an empty
  object or excluded from the serialization entirely.
- Constraints:
  - OPTIONAL
- Examples:
  - `{ "protocol": "kafka" , "endpoint": "https://example.com/queue/1234" }`

#### groups

- Type: Array of Group-References
- Description: A set of Definition Groups supported by this Endpoint. Each
  Group Reference MAY be to a Group defined outside of the current Discovery
  Service instance.

  When this property has no value it MUST either be serialized as an empty
  array or excluded from the serialization entirely.
- Constraints:
  - OPTIONAL
  - if present, the same Group, as identified by its `id` or `uri`, MUST NOT
    appear more than once within this property.
- Examples:
  - `[ { "uri": "https://example.com/discovery/group/987", "name", "John's blob store messages" } ]`

#### definitions

- Type: Array of Definition-References
- Description: A set of Message Definitions supported by this Endpoint. Each
  Definition Reference MAY be to a Definition defined outside of th current
  Discovery Service instance.

  This list is meant to be for Definitions that are not part of a Group that
  is related to this Endpoint. However, since it might not be possible to
  guarantee that there is no duplication between the two sets, if a conflict
  does appear then the Definition that is part of this property takes
  precendent over the one in the Group.

  When this property has no value it MUST either be serialized as an empty
  array or excluded from the serialization entirely.
- Constraints:
  - OPTIONAL
  - if present, the same Definition, as identified by its `id` or `uri`,
    MUST NOT appear more than once within this property.
- Examples:
  - `[ { "uri", "https://example.com/discovery/defs/8765", "name": "Blob created" } ]`

## API Specification

The relative paths specified below are NOT REQUIRED to be at the root of
the `fpath` (per RFC1738). However, they are REQUIRED to match the end of it.
For example, the following are valid URLs/paths:

```
https://example.com/
https://example.com/endpoints
https://example.com/myAggregator/groups
https://example.com/discovery/
https://example.com/discovery/definitions
```

If a Discovery Service can perform authorization checks to determine
which client can see which resource, and the requesting client is not allowed
access to a particular resource, then the Discovery Service MUST respond
as if that resource does not exist. For example, it would be excluded from
any array of Endpoints returned and it would result in a `404 Not Found`
error for a request to that Endpoints directly.

All APIs MUST support JSON encoding, which means that HTTP requests
including an HTTP `Content-Type` Header of `application/json` and body in that
format MUST be supported. Likewise requests with `Accept` header of
`application/json` MUST be supported.

Unknown query parameters on the APIs MUST be ignored.

Any resource previously returned to a client that does not appear in a
subsequent query can be assumed to be no longer available in the scope of the
query specified. In the unfiltered query case this means the resource has been
deleted. In the filtered case it is not possible to know if the resource has
been deleted or if the filters no longer apply to that resource, and therefore
it can not be assumed to be deleted.

### Filtering

In the APIs where a collection of resources are returned filtering MAY be used
to reduce the result set. To specify a filter, the `filter` query parameter
MUST be used. The format for the `filter` query parameter MUST be:

```
?filter=ATTRIBUTE[=VALUE]
```

Nested attribute names MUST be specified by using a dot (`.`) as the nesting
operator. For example: `config.protocol` references the `protocol` attribute
under the top-level `config` attribute. If a property is a collection then
specifiying that property implies that all items in the collection will be
searched and only the ones that match the remaiing part of the filter
criteria will be returned.

When an attribute is a collection then specifying that attribute in the
filter will result in a search over all items in the collection and the
remainder of the filter string will apply to any nested attributes. The
resource matches the filter criteria if any item in the collection satisfies
the criteria.

The following rules constrain the filter processing:
- The `=VALUE` portion is OPTIONAL and if not present then the implied
  meaning is that the filter MUST only match resources that contain the
  specified attribute with a non-empty value. This means a non-zero length
  strings or non-zero valued numerics.
- a `VALUE` of "" (empty string) is valid and a filter expression of
  `?filter=ATTRIBUTE=` MUST only match resources that contain the specified
  attribute with an empty string value. Note that an attribute with no
  value (or `null` depending on the data store used) MUST be treated the
  same as an attribute with an empty string (`""`) for the purpose of this
  filter feature.
- when `VALUE` is a non-empty string, then the filter expression MUST only
  match resources that contain the specified attribute with `VALUE` in any
  part of its value.
- Matching of attribute names MUST be case sensitive.
- Matching of attribute values MUST be case insensitive.
- If there are mulitple filter expressions, they MUST be specified as separate
  `filter` query parameters. When there are multiple filters, the resulting
  set of resources MUST only include ones that match all of the filters
  specified. When multiple nested attribute names are used, each nested
  attribute MUST be treated independently and the nested attributes do not
  need to be present in the same nested scope. See the sample filters below.
- Requests with unsupported filter attributes, MUST be rejected with a
  `400 Bad Request` response. Implementations SHOULD return an error message
  that indicates which filter attributes were not supported.

TODO: Add text about how we'll support the following:
```
GET /discovery?endpoints.definitions.metadata.attributes.type.value=created
GET /discovery/endpoints?definition.metadata.attributes.type.value=created
GET /discovery/definitions?metadata.attributes.type.value=created
GET /discovery/endpoints?_ce.type=created
```

Discovery Services MUST support filtering by the following attributes:

- `name`
- `id`

Other attribute MAY be supported.

Note: an empty result set is not an error and a `200 OK` with a zero sized
result set MUST be returned in those cases.

Some sample filter expressions:
| Expression | Results |
| :--- | :--- |
| /endpoints?filter=description | All resources that have a non-empty string value for `description` |
| /endpoints?filter=description= | All resources that have no value for `description`. Note: either `null` or `""` is a match |
| /endpoints?filter=description=test&filter=name=mine | All resources that have a `description` containing the string `test` (in any case), and a `name` containing the string `mine` (in any case) |
| /endpoints?filter=description=test,name=mine | All resources that have a `description` with the string `test,name=mine` (in any case) as part of its value |
| /endpoints?filter=definitions.id=123 | All endpoints that have a Definition with an `id` of `123` |

### Inlining References

As discussed in the [References](#references) section, Reference properties
will be serialized as Objects and MAY include properties of the targeted
resource for convinience.

When requesting resources from a Discovery Service instance, if the request
includes the `inline` query parameter then, except in the cases listed below,
all properties that are References to other Discovery resources MUST be
serialized as Objects that are as full representations of the target resource
and not the Object References defined in [References](#references).

The following Reference properties MUST NOT be inlined:
- Definition's `endpoints` property
- Definition's `groups` property
- Group's `endpoints` property

Additionally if while inlining a resource an infinite recursion loop is
detected then the inlining MUST stop when a resource is encountered that
already exists in the current heirarchy of the serialization.

For example, if the resource references look like:
```
      B -> C -> A
  A <
      D -> B -> C -> A
```
Then the inlining will stop on the right-most `A` in each branch. All others
will be inlined.

Note: the flag MAY be specified as `?inline` or `?inline=true` (case
sensitive). Specifying `?inline=false` disables this feature. Any value other
than `true` or `false` MUST return a `400 Bad Request` error.

### Pagination

...

### Discovery APIs

All of the following APIs specified below MUST be supported by compliant
Discovery Service implementations.

#### `GET /`

This MUST return an object that matches the following format:

            "self": "URI",
            "epoch": UINT,

            ... remainder of Group's attributes ...
        } *
    }, ?
    "definitions": {
        "ID": {
            "id": "URI-reference",
            "name": "STRING",
            "self": "URI",
            "epoch": UINT,

            ... remainder of Definition's attributes ...
        } *
    } ?
}
```

Where:
- `specversion` is the version of the Discovery Service specification that
  is supported.
- `endpoints` is a map of zero or more Endpoint resources were the key is the
  resource's `id` property
- `groups` is a map of zero or more Group resources were the key is the
  resource's `id` property
- `definitions` is a map of zero or more Defintion resources were the key is
  the resource's `id` property

If any of the above maps are empty then that property MAY be omitted from
the output.

Without any filtering specified, this MUST return all of the resources
available from the Discovery Service. Any resource that appears under another
resource MUST also be included as a stand-alone resource in its respective
map. For example, a Definition that appears within a Group will also appear
in the `definitions` map.

When filtering is specified then only the resources related to the requested
resources MUST be returned. For example, a filter that results in just one
Endpoint being returned would only include Groups and Definitions that are
related to that Endpoint.

#### `GET /endpoints`
#### `GET /definitions`
#### `GET /groups`

These MUST return a map of zero or more instances of the requested resource.

The response MUST be a JSON map of resources that adheres to the following
format:

```
200 OK
Content-Type: application/json

{
    "ID": {
        "id": "URI-reference",
        "name": "STRING",
        "self": "URI",
        "epoch": UINT,

        ... remainder of resource's attributes ...
    } *
}
```

Where the key for each map entry is the `id` of corresponding resource.

#### `GET /endpoints/ID`
#### `GET /definitions/ID`
#### `GET /groups/ID`

This MUST return the latest version of the resource with the given `ID` if
it exists.

The following responses are defined by this specification:
- `200 OK` and the resource representation in the HTTP response body.
- `404 Not Found` if the resource does not exist.

Other responses are allowed, but not defined by this specification.

In the case of `200 OK`, the response format MUST adhere to the following:

```
200 OK
Content-Type: application/json

{
    "id": "URI-reference",
    "name": "STRING",
    "self": "URI",
    "epoch": UINT,

    ... remainder of resource's attributes ...
}
```


### OpenAPI

See [Discovery Endpoint OpenAPI Specification](../discovery/discovery.yaml).

## Privacy and Security

This specification does not place restrictions on implementation's choice of
an authentication and authorization mechanism. While the list of entities
returned from each query MAY differ, the format of the output MUST adhere to
this specification.

Additionally, implementations MAY choose different authentication schemes for
each of the APIs defined in this specifications. For example, a valid choice
might be to allow the "features" APIs to not mandate any authentication at all,
while the "discovery" APIs might be restricted to authorized users.
