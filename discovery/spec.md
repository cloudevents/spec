## Overview

Message Endpoints provide a location from which Message producers and consumers
can share Messages. Endpoints could act as either consumers or producers of
Messages, and the mechanisms by which those Messages are transferred might vary.

This specification defines a set of APIs, and related documents, that allow
for the discovery of these Endpoints and their related metadata. This
information can then be used to perform actions such as:
- Subscribing for Messages
- Pushing or Pulling of Messages with the Endpoint
- Generating of Message validation code based on the schema associated with a
  Message Definition

While the specification is written in term of "messaging", it applies equally
to "eventing" since it can be considered as subset of messaging.

## Notations and Terminology

### Notational Conventions

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD",
"SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be
interpreted as described in [RFC 2119](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2119).

In the pseudo JSON format snippets `?` means the preceding property is
OPTIONAL, `*` means the preceding property MAY appear zero or more times, and
`+` means the preceding property MUST appear at least once.

### Terminology

This specification defines the following terms:

#### Discovery Service

A compliant implementation of this specification that advertises a set of
Endpoints, Groups, Definitions and other metadata to aid in the programmatic
interactions with the Endpoints.

#### Endpoint

A network accessible location that can consume or produce messages.

#### Group

A set of Definitions that are related in some way. This specification does not
define how or why they are related.

#### Definition

The description of a particular message and associated metadata, such as
the schema of the message.

## Resource Model

This section defines the resource model of a Discovery Service.

### Common Resource Properties

All resources defined by this specification have the following common
properties defined:

#### id

- Type: String
- Description: A unique identifier for the resource.
- Constraints:
  - REQUIRED
  - MUST be immutable
  - MUST be a non-empty String
  - MUST conform with
    [RFC3986/3.3](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc3986#section-3.3)
    `segment-nz-nc` syntax
  - MUST be unique across all instances of the this resource type within the
    current Discovery Service.
- Examples:
  - A UUID
  - `1234`
  - `MyCoolResource`

#### name

- Type: String
- Description: The name of the resource.
- Constraints:
  - REQUIRED
  - MUST be a non-empty string
- Examples:
  - `My Queue`
  - `Blob Store Events`
  - `Blob Delete`

#### self

- Type: URI
- Description: A unique URI for the resource. The URI MUST be a combination
  of the base URI of the list of this resource type for the current Discovery
  Service appended with the `id` of this resource.
- Constraints:
  - OPTIONAL but STRONGLY RECOMMENDED in cases where the resource is part of
    an API response.
  - MUST be a non-empty URI
- Examples:
  - `https://example.com/discovery/endpoints/MyCoolEndpoint`
  - `https://example.com/discovery/groups/234`
  - `https://example.com/discovery/definitions/569`

#### epoch

- Type: Unsigned Integer
- Description: A number representing the version number of the resource. Each
  time the resource is modified this property MUST be updated with a new value
  that is greater than the current one. Note that this version number is used
  to indicate the Discovery resource changing not the semantic version of
  the resource itself.
- Constraints:
  - REQUIRED
  - MUST be an unsigned integer
- Examples:
  - `0`
  - `1001`

#### origin

- Type: URI
- Description: A URI reference to the original source of this resource. This
  can be used to locate the true authority owner of the resource in cases of
  distributed Discovery Services. If this property is absent its default value
  is the value of the `self` property and in those cases its presence in the
  serialization of the resource is OPTIONAL.
- Constraints:
  - OPTIONAL if this Discovery Service is the authority owner
  - REQUIRED if this Discovery Service is not the authority owner
  - if present, MUST be a non-empty URI
- Examples:
  - `https://example2.com/discovery/endpoints/9876`

#### description

- Type: String
- Description: A summary of the purpose of the resource.
- Constraints:
  - OPTIONAL
  - if present, MUST be a non-empty string
- Examples:
  - "A queue of the sensor generated messages"

#### tags

- Type: Map of name/value string pairs
- Description: A mechanism in which additional metadata about the resource can
  be stored.

  When this property has no value it MUST either be serialized as an empty
  map or excluded from the serialization entirely.
- Constraints:
  - OPTIONAL
  - if present, MUST be a map of zero or more name/value string pairs
  - Each name MUST be a non-empty string (consisting of only alphanumeric
    characters, `-`, `_`, or a `.`), be no longer than 63 characters and
    unique within the scope of this map. Values MAY be empty strings
- Examples:
  - `{ "owner": "John", "verified": "" }`

#### docs

- Type: URI-Reference
- Description: A URI-reference to additional documentation about this resource.
  This specification does not define any constraints on the data returned from
  an HTTP GET this URI-reference.
- Constraints:
  - OPTIONAL
  - if present, MUST be a non-empty URI-reference
  - if present with a scheme, it MUST use either `http` or `https`
  - MUST support an HTTP GET to the specified URI-Reference
- Examples:
  - `https://example.com/docs/myQueue`

### Endpoint Resource

An Endpoint is a network accessible location that is capable of receiving or
sending messages.

The following pseudo JSON shows the defintion of an Endpoint:
```
{
    "id": "URI-reference",
    "name": "STRING",
    "self": "URI",
    "epoch": UINT,
    "origin": "URI" ?
    "description": "STRING", ?
    "tags": { "STRING": "STRING", ... }, ?
    "docs": "URL", ?

    "deprecated": { ... }, ?
    "channel", "STRING", ?
    "authscope": "URI", ?

    "usage": "subscriber|consumer|producer",
    "config": {
        "protocol": "STRING",
        "endpoints": "URL" | [ "URL", ... ],
        "options": { ... }, ?
        "strict": true|false ?
    }, ?

    "format": "STRING", ?
    "groups": [ GROUP-URI-Reference, ... ], ?
    "definitions": { "ID": DEFINITION, ... } ?
}

```

The following Endpoint properties are defined:

#### id, name, self, epoch, origin, description, tags, docs

See [Common Resource Properties](#common-resource-properties).

#### deprecated

- Type: Object containing the following properties:
  - effective<br>
    An OPTIONAL property indicating the time when the Endpoint entered, or will
    enter, a deprecated state. The date MAY be in the past or future. If this
    propety is not present the Endpoint is already in a deprecated state.
    If present, this MUST be an [RFC3339][rfc3339] timestamp.

  - removal<br>
    An OPTIONAL property indicating the time when the Endpoint MAY be removed.
    The Endpoint MUST NOT be deleted before this time. If this property is not
    present then client can not make any assumption as to when the Endpoint
    might be removed. Note: as with most Endpoint properties, this property
    is mutable. If present, this MUST be an [RFC3339][rfc3339] timestamp and
    MUST NOT be sooner than the `effective` time if present.

  - alternative<br>
    An OPTIONAL property specifying the URL to an alternative Endpoint the
    client can consider as a replacement for this Endpoint. There is no
    guarantee that the referenced Endpoint is an exact replacement, rather the
    client is expected to investigate the Endpoint to determine if it is
    appropriate.

  - docs<br>
    An OPTIONAL property specifying the URL to additional information about
    the deprecation of the Endpoint. This specification does not mandate any
    particular format or information, however some possibilities include:
    reasons for the deprecation or additional information about likely
    alternative Endpoints. The URL MUST support an HTTP GET request.

- Description: This specification makes no statement as to whether any
  existing subscription will still be valid and usable after this date.
  However, it is expected that new subscription requests after the Endpoint is
  deleted will likely be rejected.

  Note that an implementation is not mandated to use this attribute in
  advance of removing an Endpoint, but is it RECOMMENDED that they do so.
- Constraints:
  - OPTIONAL
- Examples:
  - `"deprecated": {}`
  - ```
    "deprecated": {
      "removaltime": "2030-12-19T00:00:00-00:00",
      "alternative": "https://example.com/endpoints/123"
    }
    ```

#### channel

- Type: String
- Description: A string that can be used to correlate Endpoints. Any Endpoints
  within an instance of a Discovery Service that share the same non-empty
  `channel` value MUST have some relationship. This specification does not
  define that relationship or the specific values used in this property.

  When this property has no value it MUST either be serialized as an empty
  string or excluded from the serialization entirely.
- Constraints:
  - OPTIONAL
  - if present, MUST be a string
- Examples:
  - `queue1`

#### authscope

- Type: URI-Reference
- Description: A URI-Reference to an Endpoint that represents the original
  source of truth for this Endpoint. If not present then this Endpoint does
  not have an originating Endpoint from which it is derived or related.
- Constraints:
  - OPTIONAL
- Examples:
  - https://example.com/endpoints/194575

#### usage

- Type: String
- Description: The interaction model supported by this Endpoint. This
  specification defines a set of possible values (see the
  [Usage Values](#usage-values) section for more information, however,
  implementations MAY define new values as extensions. It is RECOMMENDED
  that extension values be defined with some organizational unique string
  to reduce the chances of collisions with possible future spec-defined values.
- Constraints:
  - REQUIRED
  - MUST be a non-empty string
- Examples:
  - `consumer`

#### config

- Type: Object
- Description: Metadata that provides additional information concerning the
  interactions with this Endpoint. This metadata MUST be related to the
  `usage` value specified.

  When this property has no value it MUST either be serialized as an empty
  object or excluded from the serialization entirely.
- Constraints:
  - OPTIONAL
- Examples:
  - `{ "protocol": "kafka", "endpoints": "example.com/mykafka" }`

#### format

- Type: String
- Description: Specifies the set of rules that govern how the messages for this
  Endpoint MUST be formatted. This value can be used to definitively
  identify the type of messages without checking the individual attributes
  listed under the `metadata` property.

  If present and is not an empty string, then all Groups and Definitions
  associated with this Endpoint MUST have a `format` value that matches this
  property's value.

  See the [Message Formats](#message-formats) section for more information.

  When this property has no value it MUST either be serialized as an empty
  string or excluded from the serialization entirely.
- Constraints:
  - OPTIONAL
- Examples:
  - `cloudevents/1.0`
  - `amqp/1.0`

#### groups

- Type: Array of Group-URI-References
- Description: A set of Definition Groups supported by this Endpoint. Each
  Group Reference MAY be to a Group defined outside of the current Discovery
  Service instance.

  When this property has no value it MUST either be serialized as an empty
  array or excluded from the serialization entirely.
- Constraints:
  - OPTIONAL
  - if present, the same Group, as identified by its `id`, MUST NOT appear
    more than once within this property. It might be difficult to detect
    cases where a nested Group reference would result in a recursive situation.
    In those cases it would be an error state and this Discovery service
    is not compliant. As a means to recover from this state, a client MAY
    choose to break the recursive nature of the references by removing the
    first occurrence of a reference that refers to a previous seen parent
    reference.
- Examples:
  - `[ "https://example.com/discovery/group/987", "/groups/MyGroup" ]`

#### definitions

- Type: Collection of Definitions
- Description: A collection of Message Definitions supported by this Endpoint.
  This MUST include all Definitions defined exclusively for this Endpoint as
  well as Definitions from the `groups` property above. Clients can determine
  which are not part of those groups by finding the Definitions whose
  `ownergroup` property matches the `self` property of this Endpoint.

  When this property has no value it MUST either be serialized as an empty
  array or excluded from the serialization entirely.
- Constraints:
  - OPTIONAL
  - if present, the same Definition, as identified by its `id`, MUST NOT appear
    more than once within this property.
- Examples:
  - TBD add one

### Definition Resource

A Definition is describes the format a message that can be transfered to or
from an Endpoint. Each message is assumed to be made up of two parts:
- Metadata - OPTIONAL information used to annotate or provide additional
  information about the purpose or content of the message
- Data - the business logic of the message

Beyond allowing for a Definition to include information about the data's
schema, this specification does not concern itself with the data as that is
application specific.

A Definition allows for the inclusion of metadata to aid with the discovery of:
- additional properties that might appear in the associated message
- the type, value, description and requirements of those properties
- where those properties will appear in the message

The following pseudo JSON shows the defintion of a Definition:
```
{
    "id": "URI-reference",
    "name": "STRING",
    "self": "URI",
    "epoch": UINT,
    "origin": "URI" ?
    "description": "STRING", ?
    "tags": { "STRING": "STRING", ... }, ?
    "docs": "URL", ?

    "ownergroup": "GROUP-URI-Reference",
    "format": "STRING", ?
    "metadata": {
        "attributes": {
            "ATTRIBUTE_NAME": {
                "required": true|false,
                "description": "STRING", ?
                "value": JSON_OBJECT,
                "type": "string|object|...", ?
                "specurl": "URL" ?
            }
        } *
    }, ?
    "schema": { ... }, ?
    "schemaurl": "URL" ?
}
```

The following Definition properties are defined:

#### id, name, self, epoch, origin, description, tags, docs

See [Common Resource Properties](#common-resource-properties).

#### ownergroup

- Type: URI-Reference
- Description:
  Note: for the purposes of this discussion, Endpoints can be considered
  Groups since Endpoints extend the Groups resource with extra properties.

  When retrieving a Group, the `definitions` property will include all
  Definitions regardless of whether each was included indirectly due to a
  reference to a Group in the `groups` property or the Definition was defined
  as part of the Group. In order for a client to distinguish between these two
  situations, the `ownergroup` property will reference the Group that defined
  the Definition - thus the "owner".

- Constraints:
  - REQUIRED
  - MUST be the `self` property of the owning Group (or Endpoint).

#### format

See [Endpoint's `format`](#format) property.

#### metadata

- Type: Object
- Description: Specifies the message attributes for the Definition that will
  appear as metadata in the resulting serialized message. Note that this will
  define the metadata of the message, not the data portion of the message.

  The contents of this property will vary based on the `format` property.
  See the [Message Formats](#message-formats) section for more information.

  When this property has no value it MUST either be serialized as an empty
  object or excluded from the serialization entirely.
- Constraints:
  - OPTIONAL
- Examples:
  - TBD

#### schema

- Type: Object
- Description: An in-line definition of the schema of the message's data.

  When this property has no value it MUST either be serialized as an empty
  object or excluded from the serialization entirely.
- Constraints:
  - OPTIONAL
  - MUST NOT be present if `schemaurl` is present
- Examples:
  - TBD

#### schemaurl

- Type: URL
- Description: A URL to the schema of the message's data.
- Constraints:
  - OPTIONAL
  - if present, MUST be a non-empty URL
  - MUST NOT be present if `schema` is present
- Examples:
  - `https://example.com/schema/...` TBD

### Group Resource

A Group provides a mechanism by which a set of Definitions can be bundled and
identified as a single unit. This specification places no constraints on how
the grouping is defined nor does it mandate any semantic meaning to the
grouping.

```
{
    "id": "URI-reference",
    "name": "STRING",
    "self": "URI",
    "epoch": UINT,
    "origin": "URI" ?
    "description": "STRING", ?
    "tags": { "STRING": "STRING", ... }, ?
    "docs": "URL", ?

    "format": "STRING", ?
    "groups": [ GROUP-URI-Reference, ... ], ?
    "definitions": { "ID": DEFINITION, ... } ?
}
```

The following Group properties are defined:

#### id, name, self, epoch, origin, description, tags, docs

See [Common Resource Properties](#common-resource-properties).

#### format

See [Endpoint's `format`](#format) property.

#### groups

See [Endpoint's `groups`](#groups) property.

#### definitions

See [Endpoint's `definitions`](#definitions) property.

## Usage Values

The Endpoint `usage` value indicates how clients of the Endpoint are meant
to interact with it. There are 3 values defined by this specification:
- `subscriber`: in order for clients to receives messages from this Endpoint
  a subscribe request MUST be sent to one of the Endpoint's `config.endpoints`
  URLs. The sent messages MUST be sent using a "push" delivery mechanism to a
  location specified within the subscribe request.
- `consumer`: clients can receive messages from this Endpoint by issuing a
  "pull" type of request to one of the Endpoint's `config.endpoints` URLs.
- `producer`: clients can send messages to this Endpoint by ussing a "push"
   type of request to one of the Endpoint's `config.endpoints` URLs.

Implementations MAY defined additional `usage` values, but it is RECOMMENDED
that they are defined with some unique organizational unique string to reduce
the chances of collisions with possible future spec-defined values.

For each possible `usage` value, the Endpoint's `config.protocol` value
indicates the mechanism by which the messages will be transferred to/from the
Endpoint.

## Message Formats

```
cloudevents/1.0
amqp
kafka
```


## API Specification

The relative paths specified below are NOT REQUIRED to be at the root of
the `fpath` (per RFC1738). However, they are REQUIRED to match the end of it.
For example, the following are valid URLs/paths:

```
https://example.com/
https://example.com/endpoints
https://example.com/myAggregator/groups
https://example.com/discovery/
https://example.com/discovery/definitions
```

If a Discovery Service can perform authorization checks to determine
which client can see which resource, and the requesting client is not allowed
access to a particular resource, then the Discovery Service MUST respond
as if that resource does not exist. For example, it would be excluded from
any collection of Endpoints returned and it would result in a `404 Not Found`
error for a request to that Endpoints directly.

All APIs MUST support JSON encoding, which means that HTTP requests
including an HTTP `Content-Type` Header of `application/json` and body in that
format MUST be supported. Likewise requests with `Accept` header of
`application/json` MUST be supported.

Unknown query parameters on the APIs MUST be ignored.

Any resource previously returned to a client that does not appear in a
subsequent similar query can be assumed to be no longer available in the scope
of the query specified. In the unfiltered query case this means the resource
has been deleted. In the filtered case it is not possible to know if the
resource has been deleted or if the filters no longer apply to that resource,
and therefore it can not be assumed to be deleted.

### Filtering

In the APIs where a collection of resources are returned filtering MAY be used
to reduce the result set. To specify a filter, the `filter` query parameter
MUST be used. The format for the `filter` query parameter MUST be:

```
?filter=ATTRIBUTE[=VALUE]
```

Nested attribute names MUST be specified by using a dot (`.`) as the nesting
operator. For example: `config.protocol` references the `protocol` attribute
under the top-level `config` attribute. If a property is a collection then
specifiying that property implies that all items in the collection will be
searched and only the ones that match the remaining part of the filter
criteria will be returned.

When an attribute is a collection then specifying that attribute in the
filter will result in a search over all items in the collection and the
remainder of the filter string will apply to any nested attributes. The
resource matches the filter criteria if any item in the collection satisfies
the criteria.

The following rules constrain the filter processing:
- The `=VALUE` portion is OPTIONAL and if not present then the implied
  meaning is that the filter MUST only match resources that contain the
  specified attribute with a non-empty value. This means a non-zero length
  strings or non-zero valued numerics.
- a `VALUE` of "" (empty string) is valid and a filter expression of
  `?filter=ATTRIBUTE=` MUST only match resources that contain the specified
  attribute with an empty string value. Note that an attribute with no
  value (or `null` depending on the data store used) MUST be treated the
  same as an attribute with an empty string (`""`) for the purpose of this
  filter feature.
- when `VALUE` is a non-empty string, then the filter expression MUST only
  match resources that contain the specified attribute with `VALUE` in any
  part of its value.
- Matching of attribute names MUST be case sensitive.
- Matching of attribute values MUST be case insensitive.
- If there are mulitple filter expressions, they MUST be specified as separate
  `filter` query parameters. When there are multiple filters, the resulting
  set of resources MUST only include ones that match all of the filters
  specified. When multiple nested attribute names are used, each nested
  attribute MUST be treated independently and the nested attributes do not
  need to be present in the same nested scope. See the sample filters below.
- Requests with unsupported filter attributes, MUST be rejected with a
  `400 Bad Request` response. Implementations SHOULD return an error message
  that indicates which filter attributes were not supported.

TODO: Add text about how we'll support the following:
```
GET /discovery?endpoints.definitions.metadata.attributes.type.value=created
GET /discovery/endpoints?definition.metadata.attributes.type.value=created
GET /discovery/definitions?metadata.attributes.type.value=created
GET /discovery/endpoints?_ce.type=created
```

Discovery Services MUST support filtering by the following attributes:

- `name`
- `id`

Other attribute MAY be supported.

Note: an empty result set is not an error and a `200 OK` with a zero sized
result set MUST be returned in those cases.

Some sample filter expressions:
| Expression | Results |
| :--- | :--- |
| /endpoints?filter=description | All resources that have a non-empty string value for `description` |
| /endpoints?filter=description= | All resources that have no value for `description`. Note: either `null` or `""` is a match |
| /endpoints?filter=description=test&filter=name=mine | All resources that have a `description` containing the string `test` (in any case), and a `name` containing the string `mine` (in any case) |
| /endpoints?filter=description=test,name=mine | All resources that have a `description` with the string `test,name=mine` (in any case) as part of its value |
| /endpoints?filter=definitions.id=123 | All endpoints that have a Definition with an `id` of `123` |

### Pagination

### Discovery APIs

All of the following APIs specified below MUST be supported by compliant
Discovery Service implementations.

#### `GET /`

This MUST return an object that matches the following format:
```
{
    "specversion": "STRING",
    "endpoints": {
        "ID": {
            "id": "URI-reference",
            "name": "STRING",
            "self": "URI",
            "epoch": UINT,

            ... remainder of Endpoint's attributes ...
        } *
    }, ?
    "groups": {
        "ID": {
            "id": "URI-reference",
            "name": "STRING",
            "self": "URI",
            "epoch": UINT,

            ... remainder of Group's attributes ...
        } *
    } ?
}
```

Where:
- `specversion` is the version of the Discovery Service specification that
  is supported.
- `endpoints` is a map of zero or more Endpoint resources were the key is the
  resource's `id` property
- `groups` is a map of zero or more Group resources were the key is the
  resource's `id` property

If any of the above collections are empty then that property MAY be omitted
from the output.

Without any filtering specified, this MUST return all of the resources
available from the Discovery Service.

When filtering is specified then only the resources related to the requested
resources MUST be returned. For example, a filter that results in just one
Endpoint being returned would only include Groups that are related to that
Endpoint.

#### `GET /endpoints`
#### `GET /groups`

These MUST return a map of zero or more instances of the requested resource.

The response MUST be a JSON map of resources that adheres to the following
format:

```
200 OK
Content-Type: application/json

{
    "ID": {
        "id": "URI-reference",
        "name": "STRING",
        "self": "URI",
        "epoch": UINT,

        ... remainder of resource's attributes ...
    } *
}
```

Where the key for each map entry is the `id` of corresponding resource.

#### `GET /endpoints/ID`
#### `GET /groups/ID`
#### `GET /definitions/ID`

This MUST return the latest version of the resource with the given `ID` if
it exists.

The following responses are defined by this specification:
- `200 OK` and the resource representation in the HTTP response body.
- `404 Not Found` if the resource does not exist.

Other responses are allowed, but not defined by this specification.

In the case of `200 OK`, the response format MUST adhere to the following:

```
200 OK
Content-Type: application/json

{
    "id": "URI-reference",
    "name": "STRING",
    "self": "URI",
    "epoch": UINT,

    ... remainder of resource's attributes ...
}
```


### OpenAPI

See [Discovery Endpoint OpenAPI Specification](../discovery/discovery.yaml).

## Privacy and Security

This specification does not place restrictions on implementation's choice of
an authentication and authorization mechanism. While the list of entities
returned from each query MAY differ, the format of the output MUST adhere to
this specification.

Additionally, implementations MAY choose different authentication schemes for
each of the APIs defined in this specifications. For example, a valid choice
might be to allow the "features" APIs to not mandate any authentication at all,
while the "discovery" APIs might be restricted to authorized users.
