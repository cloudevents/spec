# CloudEvents Extension Attributes

The [CloudEvents specification](spec.md) defines a set of metadata attributes
than can be used when transforming a generic event into a CloudEvent.
The list of attributes specified in that document represent the minimal set
that the specification authors deemed most likely to be used in a majority of
situations.

This document defines some addition attributes that, while not as commonly
used as the ones specified in the [CloudEvents specification](spec.md),
could still benefit from being formally specified in the hopes of providing
some degree of interoperability. This also allows for attributes to be
defined in an experimental manner and tested prior to being considered for
inclusion in the [CloudEvents specification](spec.md).

Implementations of the [CloudEvents specification](spec.md) are not mandated
to limit their use of extension attributes to just the ones specified in
this document. The attributes defined in this document have no official
standing and might be changed, or removed, at any time.

## Usage

Support for any extension is OPTIONAL. When an extension definition uses 
[RFC 2199](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2119.txt) keywords (e.g. MUST,
SHOULD, MAY), this usage only applies to events that use the extension.

Extensions always follow a common placement strategy for in-memory
formats (e.g. [JSON](json-format.md), XML, Protobuffer) that are
decided by those representations. Transport bindings (e.g.
[HTTP](http-transport-binding.md), [MQTT](mqtt-transport-binding.md),
[AMPQ](amqp-transport-binding.md), [NATS](nats-transport-binding.md)) provide
default placement for extensions, but an extension MAY require special
representation when transported (e.g. tracing standards that require
specific headers). Extension authors SHOULD only require special
representation in transport bindings where extensions integrate with
pre-existing specs; extensions with custom transport bindings are much
more likely to be dropped by middleware that does not understand the
extension.

As a convention, extensions of scalar types (e.g. `String`, `Binary`, `URI`,
`Number`) document their `Value` and structured types document their 
`Attributes`.
