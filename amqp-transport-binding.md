## 1. Introduction

[CloudEvents][ce] is a standardized and transport-neutral definition of the
structure and metadata description of events. This specification defines how the
elements defined in the CloudEvents specification are to be used in
[AMQP][oasis-amqp-1.0] messages.

### 1.1. Conformance

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD",
"SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be
interpreted as described in [RFC2119][rfc2119].

### 1.2. Relation to AMQP

This specification does not prescribe rules constraining transfer or settlement
of event messages with AMQP; it solely defines how CloudEvents are expressed as
AMQP 1.0 messages.

AMQP-based messaging and eventing infrastructures often provide higher-level
programming-level abstractions that do not expose all AMQP protocol elements, or
map AMQP protocol elements or names to proprietary constructs. This
specification uses AMQP terminology, and implementers can refer the the
respective infrastructure's AMQP documentation to determine the mapping into a
programming-level abstraction.

This specification assumes use of the default AMQP [message
format][message-format].

### 1.3. Content Modes

The specification defines two content modes for transferring events:
_structured_ and _binary_. Every compliant implementation SHOULD support both
modes.

In the _structured_ content mode, event metadata attributes and event data are
placed into the AMQP message's [application data][data] section using an
[event format](#14-event-formats).

In the _binary_ content mode, the value of the event `data` attribute is placed
into the AMQP message's [application data][data] section as-is, with the
`datacontenttype` attribute value declaring its media type; all other event
attributes are mapped to the AMQP [application-properties][app-properties]
section.

### 1.4. Event Formats

Event formats, used with the _stuctured_ content mode, define how an event is
expressed in a particular data format. All implementations of this specification
MUST support the [JSON event format][json-format] as well as the [AMQP event
format][amqp-format] for the [application-properties][app-properties] section,
but MAY support any additional, including proprietary, formats.

### 1.5. Security

This specification does not introduce any new security features for AMQP, or
mandate specific existing features to be used.

## 2. Use of CloudEvents Attributes

This specification does not further define any of the [CloudEvents][ce] event
attributes.

Two of the event attributes, `datacontenttype` and `data` are handled specially
and mapped onto AMQP constructs, all other attributes are transferred as
metadata without further interpretation.

This mapping is intentionally robust against changes, including the addition and
removal of event attributes, and also accommodates vendor extensions to the
event metadata. Any mention of event attributes other than `datacontenttype` and
`data` is exemplary.

### 2.1. datacontenttype Attribute

The `datacontenttype` attribute is assumed to contain a [RFC2046][rfc2046]
compliant media-type expression.

### 2.2. data Attribute

The `data` attribute is assumed to contain opaque application data that is
encoded as declared by the `datacontenttype` attribute.

An application is free to hold the information in any in-memory representation
of its choosing, but as the value is transposed into AMQP as defined in this
specification, the assumption is that the `data` attribute value is made
available as a sequence of bytes.

For instance, if the declared `datacontenttype` is
`application/json;charset=utf-8`, the expectation is that the `data` attribute
value is made available as [UTF-8][rfc3629] encoded JSON text for use in AMQP.

## 3. AMQP Message Mapping

The content mode is chosen by the sender of the event, which is either the
requesting or the responding party. Protocol interaction patterns that might
allow solicitation of events using a particular content mode might be defined by
an application, but are not defined here.

The receiver of the event can distinguish between the two modes by inspecting
the `content-type` message property field. If the value is prefixed with the
CloudEvents media type `application/cloudevents`, indicating the use of a known
[event format](#14-event-formats), the receiver uses _structured_ mode,
otherwise it defaults to _binary_ mode.

If a receiver detects the CloudEvents media type, but with an event format that
it cannot handle, for instance `application/cloudevents+avro`, it MAY still
treat the event as binary and forward it to another party as-is.

### 3.1. Binary Content Mode

The _binary_ content mode accommodates any shape of event data, and allows for
efficient transfer and without transcoding effort.

#### 3.1.1. AMQP content-type

For the _binary_ mode, the AMQP `content-type` property field value maps
directly to the CloudEvents `datacontenttype` attribute.

#### 3.1.2. Event Data Encoding

The [`data` attribute](#22-data-attribute) byte-sequence is used as the AMQP
[application-data][data] section.

#### 3.1.3. Metadata Headers

All [CloudEvents][ce] attributes with exception of `datacontenttype` and `data`
MUST be individually mapped to and from the AMQP
[application-properties][app-properties] section, with exceptions noted below.

CloudEvents extensions that define their own attributes MAY define a diverging
mapping to AMQP properties for those attributes, also in different message
sections, especially if specific attributes or their names need to align with
AMQP features or with other specifications that have explicit AMQP header
bindings.

An extension specification that defines a diverging mapping rule for AMQP, and
any revision of such a specification, MUST also define explicit mapping rules
for all other transport bindings that are part of the CloudEvents core at the
time of the submission or revision.

##### 3.1.3.1 AMQP Application Property Names

Cloud Event attributes are prefixed with "cloudEvents:" for use in the
[application-properties][app-properties] section.

Examples:

    * `time` maps to `cloudEvents:time`
    * `id` maps to `cloudEvents:id`
    * `specversion` maps to `cloudEvents:specversion`

##### 3.1.3.2 AMQP Application Property Values

The value for each AMQP application property is constructed from the respective
attribute's AMQP type representation, compliant with the [AMQP event
format][amqp-format] specification.

#### 3.1.4 Examples

This example shows the _binary_ mode mapping of an event into the [bare
message][message-format] sections of AMQP:

```text
--------------- properties ------------------

to: myqueue
content-type: application/json; charset=utf-8

----------- application-properties -----------

cloudEvents:specversion: 0.3-wip
cloudEvents:type: com.example.someevent
cloudEvents:time: 2018-04-05T03:56:24Z
cloudEvents:id: 1234-1234-1234
cloudEvents:source: /mycontext/subcontext
       .... further attributes ...

------------- application-data ---------------

{
    ... application data ...
}

----------------------------------------------
```

### 3.2. Structured Content Mode

The _structured_ content mode keeps event metadata and data together in the
payload, allowing simple forwarding of the same event across multiple routing
hops, and across multiple transports.

#### 3.2.1. AMQP Content-Type

The [AMQP `content-type`][content-type] property field is set to the media type
of an [event format](#14-event-formats).

Example for the [JSON format][json-format]:

```text
content-type: application/cloudevents+json; charset=UTF-8
```

#### 3.2.2. Event Data Encoding

The chosen [event format](#14-event-formats) defines how all attributes,
including the `data` attribute, are represented.

The event metadata and data is then rendered in accordance with the event format
specification and the resulting data becomes the AMQP application [data][data]
section.

#### 3.2.3. Metadata Headers

Implementations MAY include the same AMQP application-properties as defined for
the [binary mode](#313-metadata-headers).

#### 3.2.4 Examples

This example shows a JSON event format encoded event:

```text
--------------- properties ------------------------------

to: myqueue
content-type: application/cloudevents+json; charset=utf-8

----------- application-properties ----------------------

------------- application-data --------------------------

{
    "specversion" : "0.3-wip",
    "type" : "com.example.someevent",

    ... further attributes omitted ...

    "data" : {
        ... application data ...
    }
}

---------------------------------------------------------
```
