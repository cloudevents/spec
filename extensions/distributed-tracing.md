# Distributed Tracing extension

This extension embeds context from
[W3C TraceContext](https://www.w3.org/TR/trace-context/) into a CloudEvent.
The goal of this extension is to offer means to carry context when instrumenting
CloudEvents based systems with OpenTelemetry.

The [OpenTelemetry](https://opentelemetry.io/) project is a collection
of tools, APIs and SDKs that can be used to instrument, generate, collect,
and export telemetry data (metrics, logs, and traces) to help you
analyze your softwareâ€™s performance and behavior.

The OpenTelemetry specification defines both
[Context](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-specification/blob/v1.8.0/specification/context/context.md#overview)
and
[Distributed Tracing](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-specification/blob/v1.8.0/specification/overview.md#tracing-signal)
as:

> A `Context` is a propagation mechanism which carries execution-scoped values across
 API boundaries and between logically associated execution units. Cross-cutting
 concerns access their data in-process using the same shared `Context` object.
>
> A `Distributed Trace` is a set of events, triggered as a result of a single
 logical operation, consolidated across various components of an application.
 A distributed trace contains events that cross process, network and security boundaries.

## Using the Distributed Tracing Extension

The
[OpenTelemetry Semantic Conventions for CloudEvents](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-specification/blob/v1.9.0/specification/trace/semantic_conventions/cloudevents.md)
define in which scenarios this extension should be used and how to use it.
