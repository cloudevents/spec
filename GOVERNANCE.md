# Governance

This document describes the governance process under which the Serverless
Working Group (WG) will manage this repository.

## Working Group Meetings

In order to provide equitable rights to all Working Group members,
the following process will be followed:

* Official WG meetings will be announced at least a week in advance.
* Proposed changes to any document will be done via a Pull Request (PR).
* PRs will be reviewed during official WG meetings.
* During meetings, priority will be given to PRs that appear to be ready for
  a vote over those that appear to require discussions.
* PRs should not be merged if they have had substantial changes made within
  two days of the meeting.
  Rebases, typo fixes, etc. do not count as substantial.
  Note, administrivia PRs that do not materially modify WG output documents
  may be processed by WG admins as needed.
* Resolving PRs ("merging" or "closing with no action") will be done as a
  result of a motion made during a WG meeting, and approved.
* Reopening a PR can be done if new information is made available, and a
  motion to do so is approved.
* Any motion that does not have "unanimous consent" will result in a formal
  vote. See [Voting](#voting).

## PRs

Typically, PRs are expected to meet the following criteria prior to being
merged:

* The author of the PR indicates that it is ready for review by asking for it
  to be discussed in an upcoming meeting - eg. by adding it to the agenda
  document.
* All comments have been addressed.
* PRs that have objections/concerns will be discussed off-line by interested
  parties. A resolution, updated PR, will be expected from those talks.

## Voting

If a vote is taken during a WG meeting, the follow rules will be followed:

* There is only 1 vote per participating company, or nonaffiliated individual.
* Each participating company can assign a primary and secondary representative.
* A participating company, or nonaffiliated individual, attains voting rights
  by having any of their assigned representative(s) attend 3 out of the last
  4 meetings. They obtain voting rights after the 3rd meeting, not during.
* Only WG members with voting rights will be allowed to vote.
* A vote passes if more than 50% of the votes cast approve the motion.
* Only "yes" or "no" votes count, "abstain" votes do not count towards the
  total.
* Meeting attendence will be formally tracked
  [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1bw5s9sC2ggYyAiGJHEk7xm-q2KG6jyrfBy69ifkdmt0/edit#gid=0).
  Members must acknowledge their presence verbally, meaning, adding yourself
  to the "Attendees" section of the Agenda document is not sufficient.
