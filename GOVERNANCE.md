# Governance

This document describes the governance process under which the Serverless
Working Group (WG) will manage this repository.

## Working Group Meetings

In order to provide equitable rights to all Working Group members,
the following process will be followed:

* Official WG meetings will be announced at least a week in advance.
* Proposed changes to any document will be done via a Pull Request (PR), 
  see below for policy on review and acceptance of PRs.
* During meetings, priority will be given to PRs that appear to be ready for
  a vote over those that appear to require discussions.
* Any motion that does not have "unanimous consent" will result in a formal
  vote. See [Voting](#voting).

## Working Group Membership

Anyone is welcome to attend Working Group meetings and invited to review 
PRs, whether or not they have declared formal membership in the Working Group.

We encourage everyone to document your participation in the [member list](), 
then people new to the group can learn about other folks who are involved.
Each member identifies their affiliation with an organization, company or
open source project, along with their specific use case(s) for events.

- company / org / project 
    - representative, (optional) alternate representative
    - describe how you are using or intend to use the Event specification
    
**Active Members** participate in at least three Working Group meetings per month.

## PRs

Changes fall into two categories:
- **Administrative**: grammar, spelling, minor clarifications, or git rebase.  These must be left open for at least 24 hours, then they may be merged by someone who is not the author (or +1 from a member representing a different company or organization). All comments must be addressed before merging with additional +1 once any comment has been addressed.
- **Substantive**: modifications to the name or definition of a term or additions to the specification.  When in doubt, committers should assume that a PR is substantive and leave open until next WG meeting.

PRs are expected to meet the following criteria prior to being
merged:

* The author of the PR indicates that it is ready for review by asking for it
  to be discussed in an upcoming meeting - eg. by adding it to the agenda
  document.  If the author has become inactive, then another WG member can 
  volunteeer to take on this role.
* All comments have been addressed.
* PRs that have objections/concerns will be discussed off-line by interested
  parties. A resolution, updated PR, will be expected from those talks.
* Resolving PRs ("merging" or "closing with no action") will be done as a
  result of a motion made via comment at least two days in advance of a 
  WG meeting, and approved at that meeting.
* Reopening a PR can be done if new information is made available via
  github issue, which can then be added to the agenda for WG meeting.

## Decision Making

Process:
- [Optional] Add an item to the [agenda]() for a working group meeting if you have an idea or suggestion and want some feedback before drafting a proposal. If the WG has a busy agenda, then you may be asked to convene a group of interested parties separately from the WG meetings.
- Proposals, added via PR to this github repo, must be open for at least a week, and will not be considered for decision if substantive changes were made within two days of a meeting

Most of the time we come to agreement simply by revising a proposed change or addition until all of the issues raised are addressed.  Occasionally, the Working Group may choose to overrule a minority viewpoint by calling for a vote by active members of the Working Group, as described below.  

If a minority viewpoint is supported by an member with an implementation, the vote cannot be held until there is an open source implementation that illustrates the benefits or drawbacks of the proposal.  

If a vote is taken during a WG meeting, the follow rules will be followed:

* There is only 1 vote per Active Member
* A vote passes if more than 50% of the votes cast approve the motion.
* Only "yes" or "no" votes count, "abstain" votes do not count towards the
  total.
* Meeting attendence will be formally tracked
  [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1bw5s9sC2ggYyAiGJHEk7xm-q2KG6jyrfBy69ifkdmt0/edit#gid=0).
  Members must acknowledge their presence verbally, meaning, adding yourself
  to the "Attendees" section of the Agenda document is not sufficient.
