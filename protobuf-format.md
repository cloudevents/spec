# Protocol Buffers Event Format for CloudEvents - Version 0.3

## Abstract

The Protocol Buffers Format for CloudEvents (CE) defines the encoding of
CloudEvents in the Protocol Buffers binary format.

## Status of this document

This document is a working draft.

## 1. Introduction

This specification defines how the
[Context Attributes](spec.md#context-attributes) defined in the CloudEvents
specification MUST be encoded in the protocol buffer binary format. Transcoding
to and from other formats (e.g. JSON) is out of the scope of this document.

Protocol Buffers are a language-neutral, platform-neutral extensible mechanism
for serializing structured data. The
[Google reference implementation of Protocol Buffers](https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf)
includes support for an interface descriptor language (IDL), and this document
makes use of language level 3 IDL from Protocol Buffers v3.5.0. CloudEvents
systems using Protocol Buffers are not mandated to use the IDL or any particular
implementation of Protocol Buffers as long as they produce messages which match
the binary encoding defined by the IDL.

### 1.1. Conformance

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD",
"SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be
interpreted as described in [RFC2119](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2119).

## 2. Protocol Buffers format

Protocol Buffers provide a binary data serialization format which is
substantially more compact and efficient to parse when compared to XML or JSON,
along with a variety of language-specific libraries to perform automatic
serialization and deserialization. The
[Protocol Buffers specification defines a well-known encoding format](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/encoding)
which is the basis of this specification. This specification is described using
the Protocol Buffers project IDL for readability, but the ultimate basis of this
specification is the Protocol Buffers binary encoding.

### 2.1 Definition

Users of Protocol Buffers MUST use a message whose binary encoding is identical
to the one described by the [CloudEventMap message](./cloudevent.proto):

```proto
syntax = "proto3";

package io.cloudevents;

// allows a map to appear inside `oneof`
message CloudEventMap {
  map<string, CloudEventAny> value = 1;
}

message CloudEventAny {
  oneof value {
    string string_value = 1;
    bytes binary_value = 2;
    uint32 int_value = 3;
    CloudEventMap map_value = 4;
  }
}
```

The CloudEvents type system MUST be mapped into the fields of `CloudEventAny` as
follows:

| CloudEvents   | CloudEventAny field                                                                                                                         |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| String        | string_value                                                                                                                                |
| Binary        | binary_value                                                                                                                                |
| URI-reference | string_value (string expression conforming to URI-reference as defined in [RFC 3986 ยง4.1](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3986#section-4.1)) |
| Timestamp     | string_value (string expression as defined in [RFC 3339](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3339))                                              |
| Map           | map_value                                                                                                                                   |
| Integer       | int_value                                                                                                                                   |
| Any           | Not applicable. Any is the enclosing CloudEventAny message itself                                                                           |

Protocol Buffer representations of CloudEvents MUST use the media type
`application/cloudevents+proto`.

## 3. Examples

Below is an example of how to create a CloudEvent Protocol Buffer message using
the Java Google Protocol Buffers library:

```java
import com.google.common.base.Charsets;
import com.google.protobuf.ByteString;


CloudEventMap event = CloudEventMap.newBuilder()
  .putValue(
    "type",
    CloudEventAny.newBuilder()
      .setStringValue("com.example.emitter.event")
      .build())
  .putValue(
    "specversion",
    CloudEventAny.newBuilder()
      .setStringValue("0.3")
      .build())
  .putValue(
    "time",
    CloudEventAny.newBuilder()
      .setStringValue("2018-10-25T00:00:00+00:00")
      .build())
  .putValue(
    "source",
    CloudEventAny.newBuilder()
      .setStringValue("com.example.source.host1")
      .build())
  .putValue(
    "comExampleCustomextension",
    CloudEventAny.newBuilder()
      .setStringValue("some value for the extension")
      .build())
  .putValue(
    "data",
    CloudEventAny.newBuilder()
      .setBinaryValue(ByteString.copyFrom("a binary string", Charsets.UTF_8))
      .build())
  .build();
```
