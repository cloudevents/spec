## Roadmap

The CloudEvents Roadmap.

*Setup*

1. Establish governance, contributing guidelines and initial stakeholders.
1. Define design goals for CloudEvents V.1.
1. Describe the scope of the specification.
1. Draft educational materials that provide context for reading the spec.

*0.1*

1. Draft specification that WG members agree *could* provide interoperability.
1. Document at least 3 sample events that conform to the specification.
1. Github repo is organized to be approachable to a engineers who might want to
implement the spec.
1. Additional materials:
  1. Use-cases.
  1. Placeholder for protocol specification, folder and brief starter doc for
  HTTP.
1. Finalize logo.
1. Create and deploy a website that features a simple overview, email list and directs visitors to Github.
1. Store all website assets in the CloudEvents repository, under the governance
of the working group.


*0.2*

1. Have at least 2 implementations of the specification that can demonstrate interoperability.
1. Changes to the spec to facilitate adoption.
1. HTTP protocol specification.
1. Draft documentation and developer guide.
1. Publicize at conferences ([CloudNativeCon Europe](https://events.linuxfoundation.org/events/kubecon-cloudnativecon-north-america-2018/)).

*0.3*

1. Interoperability demo.
  1. At least one open source implementation of sending and receiving events.
  1. Events are sent by code written by Developer1 and recieved by code written by Developer2, where Developer1 has no knowledge of Developer2.
  1. Draft trigger specification (e.g. how events + actions are associated).
1. Draft documentation and user guides.

*0.4*

1. Incorporate learnings and feedback from interop demo to support wider adoption.
1. Collaborate on libraries and supporting tools to use CloudEvents and
integrate it with the ecosystem.
