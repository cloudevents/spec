    description: A partition key for the event, typically for the purposes of
      defining a causal relationship/grouping between multiple events. In cases
      where the CloudEvent is delivered to an event consumer via multiple hops,
      it is possible that the value of this attribute might change, or even be
      removed, due to protocol semantics or business processing logic within
      each hop.
