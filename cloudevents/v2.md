# CloudEvents Version 2 Consideration List

<!-- no verify-specs -->

The list below contains the set of changes that the group had identified as
potential candidates for a v2 of the CloudEvents specification. There no
guarantee as to when, or if, a v2 might happen, or that any of these will be
adopted. Rather this list is just a reminder to consider them so that we can
reduce the number of open issues and PRs on our backlog.

- [Why does the HTTP binding for batch require the same spec version for all events in the batch?](https://github.com/cloudevents/spec/issues/807)
- [handling of datacontenttype is inconsistent](https://github.com/cloudevents/spec/issues/558)
- [fix(protobuf)!: Expose CloudEvent structure with explicit fields](https://github.com/cloudevents/spec/pull/1354)
