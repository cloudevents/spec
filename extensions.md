# CloudEvents Extension Attributes

The [CloudEvents specification](spec.md) defines a set of metadata attributes
than can be used when tranforming a generic event into a CloudEvent.
The list of attributes specified in that document represent the minimal set
that the specification authors deemed most likely to be used in a majority of
situations.

This document defines some addition attributes that, while not as commonly
used as the ones specified in the [CloudEvents specification](spec.md),
could still benefit from being formally specified in the hopes of providing
some degree of interoperabilty. This also allows for attributes to be
defined in an experimental manner and tested prior to being considered for
inclusion in the [CloudEvents specification](spec.md).

Implementations of the [CloudEvents specification](spec.md) are not mandated
to limit their use of extension attributes to just the ones specified in
this document. The attributes defined in this document have no official
standing and might be changed, or removed, at any time.
