When filing an issue in this repository, please consider the following:

- Is this:
  - A feature request for a new form of integration etc?
  - A report of a technical issue with the existing spec?
  - A suggestion for improving the clarity of the existing spec
    (even if it's not "wrong" as such)?
  - Something else?
- Is there context behind your request that would be useful for readers to
  understand? (There's no need to go into huge amounts of detail, but a few
  sentences about the motivation can be really helpful.)
- Do you know *roughly* what you'd expect a change to address this issue would
  look like? If so, it's useful to create a PR at the same time, linking to
  the issue. This doesn't need to be polished and ready to merge - it's just to
  help clarify roughly what you're considering.

If the issue is requires discussion, it's really useful if you're able to
attend the weekly working group meeting as described
[here](https://github.com/cloudevents/spec/?tab=readme-ov-file#meeting-time).
Often a discussion which would take multiple back-and-forth comments on an
issue can be resolved with a few minutes of conversation. We understand the
timing may not be convenient for everyone - please let us know if that's the
case, and we can potentially arrange something with the most relevant group
members at a more convenient time.
