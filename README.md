# CloudEvents

Events are everywhere.  However, event publishers tend to describe events
differently.

The lack of a common way of describing events means developers must constantly
re-learn how to receive events.  This also limits the potential for libraries,
tooling and infrastructure to aide the delivery of event data across
environments, like SDKs, event routers or tracing systems.  The portability and
productivity we can achieve from event data is hindered overall.

Enter CloudEvents, a specification for describing event data in a common way.
CloudEvents seeks to ease event declaration and delivery across services,
platforms and beyond.

CloudEvents is a new effort and has received a surprising amount of industry
interest, ranging from major cloud providers to popular SaaS companies.
CloudEvents is hosted by the
[Cloud Native Computing Foundation](https://cncf.io) (CNCF) as a sandbox
level project.

## Working Group process

The CNCF Serverless WG is working to formalize the [specification](spec.md)
based on [design goals](primer.md#design-goals) which focus on interoperability
between systems which generate and respond to events.

In order to achieve these goals, the Serverless WG must describe:
- Common attributes of an *event* that facilitate interoperability
- One or more common architectures that are in active use today or planned to
  be built by WG members
- How events are transported from producer to consumer via at least one protocol
- Identify and resolve whatever else is needed for interoperability
