# CloudEvents

Events are everywhere.  However, event publishers tend to describe events
differently.

The lack of a common way of describing events means developers must constantly
re-learn how to receive events.  This also limits the potential for libraries,
tooling and infrastructure to aide the delivery of event data across
environments, like SDKs, event routers or tracing systems.  The portability and
productivity we can achieve from event data is hindered overall.

Enter CloudEvents, a specification for describing event data in a common way.
CloudEvents seeks to ease event declaration and delivery across services,
platforms and beyond.

CloudEvents is a new effort and it's still under active development.  However,
its working group has received a surprising amount of industry interest,
ranging from major cloud providers to popular SaaS companies.  Our end goal is
to offer this specification to the
[Cloud Native Computing Foundation](https://www.cncf.io/).
