# CloudEvents

Events are everywhere. However, event producers tend to describe events
differently.

The lack of a common way of describing events means developers must constantly
re-learn how to consume events. This also limits the potential for libraries,
tooling and infrastructure to aide the delivery of event data across
environments, like SDKs, event routers or tracing systems. The portability and
productivity we can achieve from event data is hindered overall.

CloudEvents is a specification for describing event data in common formats to
provide interoperability across services, platforms and systems.

CloudEvents has received a large amount of industry interest, ranging from major
cloud providers to popular SaaS companies. CloudEvents is hosted by the
[Cloud Native Computing Foundation](https://cncf.io) (CNCF) and was approved as
a Cloud Native sandbox level project on
[May 15, 2018](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1KNSv70fyTfSqUerCnccV7eEC_ynhLsm9A_kjnlmU_t0/edit#slide=id.g37acf52904_1_41).

If you are new to CloudEvents, it is recommended that you start by reading the
[Primer](cloudevents/primer.md) for an overview of the specification's goals
and design decisions, and then move on to the
[core specification](cloudevents/spec.md).

Since not all event producers generate CloudEvents by default, there is
documentation describing the recommended process for adapting some popular
events into CloudEvents, see
[CloudEvents Adapters](https://github.com/cloudevents/spec/blob/master/adapters.md).

## SDKs

In addition to the documentation mentioned above, there is also an
[SDK proposal](cloudevents/SDK.md). A set of SDKs is also being developed:

- [CSharp](https://github.com/cloudevents/sdk-csharp)
- [Go](https://github.com/cloudevents/sdk-go)
- [Java](https://github.com/cloudevents/sdk-java)
- [Javascript](https://github.com/cloudevents/sdk-javascript)
- [PHP](https://github.com/cloudevents/sdk-php)
- [Python](https://github.com/cloudevents/sdk-python)
- [Ruby](https://github.com/cloudevents/sdk-ruby)
- [Rust](https://github.com/cloudevents/sdk-rust)

## Process

The CloudEvents project is working to formalize the
[specification](cloudevents/spec.md) based on
[design goals](cloudevents/primer.md#design-goals) which focus on
interoperability between systems which generate and respond to events.

In order to achieve these goals, the project must describe:

- Common attributes of an _event_ that facilitate interoperability
- One or more common architectures that are in active use today or planned to be
  built by its members
- How events are transported from producer to consumer via at least one protocol
- Identify and resolve whatever else is needed for interoperability

for the latest information on how to join the calls.

Recording from our calls are available
[here](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLj6h78yzYM2Ph7YoBIgsZNW_RGJvNlFOt).

Periodically, the group may have in-person meetings that coincide with a major
conference. Please see the
