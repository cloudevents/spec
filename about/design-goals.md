# CloudEvents Specification Design Goals

CloudEvents are typically used in a distributed system to allow for services to
be loosely coupled during development, then configured with tight-coupling for
specific applications.

The goal of the CloudEvents specification is to define interoperability of event
systems that allow cloud providers, third-party tools and services to provide:
- new event sources
- new event consumers
- observability, such as monitoring, debugging and visualization,
- developer tools and libraries

## Key properties of the system:
- Source & action may be developed and deployed independently
- Trigger configuration allows for actions to be invoked based on a condition
(e.g. for a specific event type generated by a source, optionally filtered by
specific attribute values, such as a Function which is invoked when an image is
uploaded to specific S3 or Google Cloud Storage “bucket” path)
- Events are uniquely identified to facilitate developer velocity and tooling:
  - a unique idenfier allows for idempotency for reliable implementation
  - structured event definitions allow the consumer to rely on a specific format
- Common metadata attributes allow for observability via tools whithout
knowledge of the specific implementation of an event system and also can provide
value without detailed handling of the specifics of the unique event data
- CloudEvents may be transported from source to action with different protocols.

In order to achieve the above goals and desired system properties, the
Serverless WG must agree on a common vocabulary with precise definitions
describing the key elements of the system including:
- [Source](../spec.md#source)
- Action <use definition from starter doc>
- Trigger: the condition that causes an event to be transmitted from source to
action
- Rule: the association of trigger + action

In order to achieve the interoperability goals, the Serverless WG must describe:
- One or more common architectures that are in active use today or planned to be
built by WG members
- How events are transported from source to action via at least one protocol
- Whether a shared trigger specification is needed, or if runtime
interoperability can be achieved independently, then shared configuration and/or
API definition can be addressed as follow-on work
- Authorization model(s) that control access and execution permissions


## Non-Goals of this spec
The following non-goals may be follow-on work, yet would not be included in the
1.0 specification.
- Function build and invocation process
- Language-specific runtime APIs
