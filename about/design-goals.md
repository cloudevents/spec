# CloudEvents Specification Design Goals

CloudEvents are typically used in a distributed system to allow for services to
be loosely coupled during development, then may be configured with
tight-coupling for specific applications or dynamically configured at runtime.

The goal of the CloudEvents specification is to define interoperability of event
systems that allow cloud providers, third-party tools and services to provide:
- new event sources
- new event consumers
- observability, such as monitoring, debugging and visualization,
- developer tools and libraries

## Key properties of the system:
- Source & action may be developed and deployed independently
- Trigger configuration allows for actions to be invoked based on a condition
(e.g. for a specific event type generated by a source, optionally filtered by
specific attribute values, such as a Function which is invoked when an image is
uploaded to specific S3 or Google Cloud Storage “bucket” path)
- Events are uniquely identified to facilitate developer velocity and tooling:
  - a unique idenfier allows for idempotency for reliable implementation
  - structured event definitions allow the consumer to rely on a specific format
- Common metadata attributes allow for observability via tools whithout
knowledge of the specific implementation of an event system and also can provide
value without detailed handling of the specifics of the unique event data
- CloudEvents may be transported from source to action with different protocols.

In order to achieve the above goals and desired system properties, the
Serverless WG must agree on a common vocabulary with precise definitions
describing the key elements of the system including:
- [Source](../spec.md#source)
- Action: An action consumes an event, producing a behavior or effect which was
triggered by a specific *occurrence* from a specific *source*.  While the
details of how events are delivered to an action is outside of the scope of the
specification, the purpose of generating an *event* is typcially to allow other
systems to easily react to changes in a source that they do not control. The
*source* and action are often built by different developers.

Examples:
- the *source* is a managed service and the *action* is custom
code in a serverless Function (such as AWS Lambda or Google Cloud Functions).
- the *source* is an IoT device and the *event* is transmitted through an API
Gateway to the *action*, a service provided by a different developer.

The events system provides a way for the developer to specify which *event*
should be delivered to which *action*. The specific mechanism is outside the
scope of the specification, yet the following definitions faciltate an
understanding of how CloudEvent are typically used in context:
- Trigger: the condition that causes an event to be transmitted from source to
action
- Rule: the association of trigger + action

Systems which generate events can have independent mechanisms for how triggers
are specified and how rules are stored and evaluated.
