# CloudEvents Specification Design Goals

CloudEvents are typically used in a distributed system to allow for services to be loosely coupled during development, then then configured with tight-coupling for specific applications.

The goal of the CloudEvents specification is to allow for different cloud providers to create interoperable event systems, that allow for third-party tools and services to provide:
- new event sources
- new event consumers
- observability, such as monitoring, debugging and visualization,
- developer tools and libraries

Key properties of the system:
- Source & action may be developed and deployed independently
- Trigger configuration allows for actions to be invoked based on a condition (e.g. for a specific event type generated by a source, optionally filtered by specific attribute values, such as a Function which is invoked when an image is uploaded to specific S3 or Google Cloud Storage “bucket” path
- Events are uniquely identified so that developers can write code that is idempotent
- Common meta-data attributes allow for observability via tools that are developed without knowledge of the specific implementation of an event system
- CloudEvents may be transported from source to action with different protocols.

In order to achieve the above goals and desired system properties, the Serverless WG must agree on a common vocabulary with precise definitions describing the key elements of the system including:
- Source
- Action
- Trigger: the condition that causes an event to be transmitted from source to action
- Rule: the association of trigger + action

In order to achieve the interoperability goals, the Serverless WG must describe:
- One or more common architectures that are in active use today or planned to be built by WG members
- How events are transported from source to action via at least one protocol
- Whether a shared trigger specification is needed, or if runtime interoperaability can be achieved independently, then shared configuration and/or API definition can be addressed as follow-on work
- Authorization model(s)
