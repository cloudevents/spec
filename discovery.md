# CloudSubscriptions: Discovery - Version 0.1-wip

## Abstract

CloudSubscriptions Discovery API is a vendor-neutral API specification for
determining what events are available from a particular service, as well as
how to subscribe to those events.

## Status of this document

This is a working draft. Breaking changes could be made in the next minor
version.

## Overview

In order for consumers to receive events from services, they need
to first subscribe, or ask for, events from those services. To do so, there
is often a process necessary that involves steps such as discovering which
service is of interest, what events it generates and how to create the
subscription for those events.

This specification defines a set of APIs to allow for consumers to perform
these queries against a "Discovery Endpoint". A Discovery Endpoint acts
as a catalog of [Services](#service) (event producers), that consumers can
query to find the ones of interest. Once found, additional metadata is
provided in order to consume and subscribe to events. The goal
of this API is to be such that tooling can be built where all all possible
services and event types aren't known in advance.

The deployment relationship of a Discovery Endpoint to the Services and
Event Producers that it advertises is out of scope of this specification.
For example, a Discovery Endpoint could choose to be implemented as part of a
Service, or Event Producer, or it could be acting as an independent aggregrator
of this metadata. This implementation detail will be transparent to consumers.

There are several discovery use cases to consider from the viewpoint of event
consumers.

1. What services are available, and what event types do they generate?
2. What event types are available, and from which services?

The second case becomes relevant if multiple services support the same event
types. Use case 1 is likely the dominant use case. Given the example of a public
cloud provider where all services generate events, there might be dozens of
sources and hundreds of event types. The discovery funnel of
services first, then event types helps users navigate without having to see
large lists of event types. Both of these cases show the importance of using
filters in the discovery API to narrow down the selection of available events.

The CloudEvent `source` attribute is a potential cause of high fanout. For
example, consider a blob storage system where each directory constitutes a
distinct `source` attribute value. For this reason, the exact CloudEvents
`source` attribute value that might appear in a CloudEvent will not appear in
the Discovery API query result. Instead, a higher level classifier
(`service`) will be used to represent the abstract notion of the generic
event producer of those events - in the example case, the blob storage service
itself.

## Notations and Terminology

### Notational Conventions

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD",
"SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be
interpreted as described in [RFC 2119](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2119).

### Terminology

Note: some of the terms defined below are taken from the
[CloudEvents](spec.md) specification, and are marked with a reference to
the original definition. Any difference between the definitions is accidental
and the CloudEvents version takes precendence.

This specification defines the following terms:

#### Discovery Endpoint

A compliant implementation of this specification that advertises the set
of Services, Event Types and other metadata to aid in the creation of an
Event Subcription.

#### Service

A "service" represents the entity which manages one or more event
[sources](#source-ce) and is associated with [producers](#producer-ce)
that are responsible for the generatation of events.

For example, an Object Store service might have a set of event sources
where each event source maps to a bucket.

#### Source [[CE](./spec.md#source)]

The "source" is the context in which the occurrence happened. In a distributed
system it might consist of multiple Producers. If a source is not aware of
CloudEvents, an external producer creates the CloudEvent on behalf of the
source.

#### Producer [[CE](./spec.md#producer)]

The "producer" is a specific instance, process or device that creates the data
structure describing the CloudEvent.

#### Intermediary [[CE](./spec.md#intermediary)]

An "intermediary" receives a message containing an event for the purpose of
forwarding it to the next receiver, which might be another intermediary or a
[Consumer](#consumer-ce). A typical task for an intermediary is to route the
event to receivers based on the information in the
event [Context](./spec.md#context).

#### Consumer [[CE](./spec.md#consumer)]

A "consumer" receives the event and acts upon it. It uses the context and data
to execute some logic, which might lead to the occurrence of new events.

#### Subscription

The request for events from a Service.


## API Specification

This API is specified as a REST API with well defined entities and
relationships between those entities.

### Services

At the core of the data model is the concept of a [Service](#service). The
API then exposes multiple ways to query over a list of Services. To help
explain the Service resource, the following non-normative pseudo json shows
its basic structure:

(`*` means zero or more, `+` means one or more, `?` means optional)

Service:
```
{
  "url": "[unique URL to this service]",
  "name": "[unique name for this services]",
  "description": "[human string]", ?
  "docsurl": "[URL reference for human documentation]", ?
  "specversions": [ "[ce-specversion value]" + ],
  "subscriptionurl": "[URL to which the Subscribe request will be sent]",
  "subscriptionconfig": { ?
    "[key]": "[value]", *
  },
  "authscope": "[string]", ?
  "protocols": [ "[string]" + ],
  "types": [ ?
    { *
      "type": "[ce-type value]",
      "description": "[human string]", ?
      "datacontenttype": "[ce-datacontenttype value]", ?
      "dataschema": "[ce-dataschema URI]", ?
      "dataschematype": "[string per RFC 2046]", ?
      "dataschemacontent": "[schema]", ?
      "extensions": [ ?
        { *
          "name": "[CE context attribute name]",
          "type": "[CE type string]",
          "specurl": "[URL to specification defining the extension]" ?
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

An example:
```json
{
  "url": "https://example.com/services/widgetService",
  "specversions": [ "1.0" ],
  "subscriptionurl": "https://events.example.com",
  "protocols": [ "HTTP" ],
  "type": [
    {
      "type": "com.example.widget.create",
      "type": "com.example.widget.delete"
    }
  ]
}
```

Note: the above is just a sample and implementations are free to use any
internal model they wish to store the data as long as they are compliant
with the wire format/API defined by this specification.

#### Service Examples

```json
{
  "url": "https://storage.example.com/service/storage",
  "name": "storage",
  "description": "Blob storage in the cloud",
  "service_uri": "https://cloud.example.com/docs/storage",
  "types": [
    {
      "type": "com.example.storage.object.create",
      "specversions": [ "1.x-wip" ],
      "datacontenttype": "application/json",
      "dataschema": "http://schemas.example.com/download/com.example.storage.object.create.json",
      "sourcetemplate": "https://storage.example.com/service/storage/{objectID}"
    }
  ]
}
```

### REST Paths

Each path in the REST API represents either a list (or search) over
the Discovery Endpoint, or the retrieval of an individual entity. All of
these operations MUST be supported by compliant discovery implementations.

Note: the relative paths specified below are NOT REQUIRED to be at the root
of the `fpath` (per RFC1738). However, they are REQUIRED to match the end
of it. For example, the follow are valid URLs/paths:

```
https://example.com/services
https://example.com/myAggregator/services
```

Note: for each query if the client is not authorized to see any particular
entity then that entity MUST be excluded from the response. In cases where
response is a single entity, then the response MUST result in an error
as if the entity did not exist (e.g. for HTTP the response would be 
`404 Not Found`). In cases where the response is an array, then the response
MUST return a successful status with an array, even if that array is empty.

#### Services

#### `/services`

This MUST return an array of zero or more Services. The list MUST contain
all Services available via this Discovery Enpoint.

When encoded in JSON, the response format MUST adhere to the following:

```
[
  {
    "url": "SERVICE-URL",
    "name": "{name}",
    ... remainder of Service attributes ...
  }
  ...
]
```

##### `/services/{name}`

If this refers to a valid Service, then this MUST return that single
Service entity.

When encoded in JSON, the response format MUST adhere to the following:

```
{
  "url": "SERVICE-URL",
  "name": "{name}",
  ... remainder of Service attributes ...
}
```

##### `/services?matching=[search term]`

Same as `/services` but the array MUST be limited to just those Services
whose `name` attribute contains the `search term` value (case insensitive).

###### matching

* Type: `string`
* Description: Search term that provides case insensitive match against
  the Service's `name` attribute. The parameter can match any portion
  of the service's `name` value.
* Constraints:
  * OPTIONAL
  * If present, MUST be non-empty
* Examples:
  * `"storage"`
    * matches:
      * `"Awesome Cloud Storage"`
      * `"File storage system"`
      * `"storage Storage STORAGE"`


#### Types

##### `/types`

This MUST return an array of zero or more Types values, where each Type's
value is an array of Services that support that Type.

When encoded in JSON, the response format MUST adhere to the following:

```
[
  "TYPE-VALUE": [
    {
      "url": "SERVICE-url",
      "name: "{name}",
      ... remainder of Service attributes ...
    }
    ...
  ]
  ...
]
```

##### `/types/{type}`

This MUST returns an array of one or more Services that support the Type value
specified. Type value MUST conform to the [CloudEvents type](./spec.md#type)
attribute specification.

When encoded in JSON, the response format MUST adhere to the following:

```
{
  "TYPE-VALUE": [
    {
      "url": "SERVICE-url",
      "name: "{name}",
      ... remainder of Service attributes ...
    }
    ...
  ]
}
```

##### `/types?matching=[search term]`

Same as `/types` but the array MUST be limited to just those Types
whose value contains the `search term` value (case insensitive).

###### matching

* Type: `string`
* Description: Search term that provides case insensitive match against
  the Type's value. The parameter can match any portion of the value.
* Constraints:
  * OPTIONAL
  * If present, MUST be non-empty
* Examples:
  * `"com.storage.object"`
    * matches:
      * `"com.storage.object.create"`
      * `"com.storage.object.delete"`
      * `"com.storage.object.update"`
  * `"storage"`
    * matches:
      * `"com.storage.object.create"`
      * `"com.storage.object.delete"`
      * `"com.storage.object.update"`
  * `"create"`
    * matches:
      * `"com.storage.object.create"`


## Protocol Bindings

The discovery API can be implemented over different API systems. We provide
API schema definitions for implementing this API using OpenAPI and gRPC as
illustrative examples.

### HTTP Binding

When using JSON, the HTTP `Content-Type` value MUST be `application/json`.

...

### OpenAPI

...

## Privacy and Security

The CloudDiscovery API does not place restrictions on implementation's choice
of an authentication and authorization mechanism. While the list of entities
returned from each query MAY differ, the format of the output MUST adhere
to this specification.
