# CloudSubscriptions: Discovery - Version 0.1-rc01

## Abstract

CloudSubscriptions Discovery API is a vendor-neutral API specification for
determining what events an Event Producer or Aggregator / Broker
has available, as well as how to subscribe to those events.

## Status of this document

This is a working draft. Breaking changes could be made in the next minor
version.

## Overview

The goal of the CloudDiscovery API is to enable connection between consumers of
events and producers / aggregators / brokers of events and to facilitate the
creation of CloudSubscriptions.

Discovery must allow for an event producer or intermediary component to
advertise the event types that are available, provide the necessary information
to consume that event (schema / delivery protocol options), and the necessary
information to create a subscription. The output of the API must be such that
tooling can be built where all possible event producers and types arenâ€™t known
in advance.

There are several discovery use cases to consider from the viewpoint of event
consumers.

1. What sources are available, and what event types do they produce, and
   (optionally) what `source` attributes are available?
2. What event types are available, and from which providers.

The second case becomes relevant if multiple providers support the same event
types. Use case 1 is likely the dominant use case. Given the example of a public
cloud provider where all producers produce events, there may be dozens of
sources (producer systems) and hundreds of event types. The discovery funnel of
producer first, then event types helps users navigate without having to see large
lists of event types. Both of these cases require that filters can be used
in the discovery API to narrow down the selection of available events.

The CloudEvent source attribute is a potential source of high fanout. For
example consider a blob storage system where each directory constitutes a
distinct `source` attribute value. For this reason, source is not the starting
point for discovery, but an attribute that can be used when creating
subscriptions. A producer is free to show different possible source values
to different users in their system.

There are use cases where the Discovery API is served as a collection of other
producers. These take two forms:

1. Aggregator
2. Events Broker

In the aggregator case, discovery is a combined set of producers for where the
discovery is passed through largely unmodified and subscriber URIs are generally
absolute (back to the producer).

In the events broker use case, it is allowable to modify the output of
discovery and subscription URIs will be relative to the broker itself.

## Notations and Terminology

### Notational Conventions

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD",
"SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be
interpreted as described in [RFC 2119](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2119).

### Terminology

This specification defines the following terms:

#### Producer

The "producer" is a specific instance, process or device that creates the data
structure describing the CloudEvent.

#### Intermediary

An "intermediary" receives a message containing an event for the purpose of
forwarding it to the next receiver, which might be another intermediary or a
consumer. A typical task for an intermediary is to route the event to receivers
based on the information in the event context.

#### Source

The "source" is the context in which the occurrence happened. In a distributed
system it might consist of multiple Producers. If a source is not aware of
CloudEvents, an external producer creates the CloudEvent on behalf of the
source.

#### Consumer

A "consumer" receives the event and acts upon it. It uses the context and data
to execute some logic, which might lead to the occurrence of new events.

#### Subscription

The request for events from an Event Producer system.

#### Event Subscriber

The entity managing the lifecycle of a Subscription on behalf of an Event
Consumer. In some instances this might be the same entity as the Event Consumer.

## API Specification

The discovery API takes the declarative API design approach. This document
structure focuses on discovery where each document has a two part key of
`producer` and `type`. This takes a denormalized view where the composite key
of documents is the `producer` and `type`. Producer is defined as an arbitrary
human readable string and type is the CloudEvent type attribute.

### Producer entity Attributes

The `Producer` entity is the main component of the discovery API. This section
covers the structure of that entity and the next section describes the
requirements for the query API.

### Query API

The query operation MUST be supported by compliant Event Producers. It is used
by the Event Subscriber to get information about the events that the Event
Producer produces. To retrieve the list of events produced by an Event Producer,
the following data is to be provided. The query operation takes a key/value map
(`config`) of type `string` to `string`.

Each query parameter that is provided is an `and` operation. Each parameter
MUST support exact match and prefix matching operations. Prefix matching uses
the syntax of `prefix*` where the `*` character represents the end of the
prefix.

  events.

  - "Awesome Cloud Storage"
  - "Awesome Cloud\*"

##### source

- Type: `String`

- Constraints:
  - OPTIONAL
  - If present, must be non-empty
- Examples:
  - "/sensors/\*"
  - "/sensors/tn-1234567/alerts"

##### type

- Type: `String`
- Description: The specific [type](#type) to query for.
- Constraints:
  - OPTIONAL
  - If present, must be non-empty
- Examples:
  - "com.github.pull.create"

## Example Usage


## Protocol Bindings

The discovery API can be implemented over different API systems. We provide
API schema definitions for implementing this API using OpenAPI and gRPC as
illustrative examples.

### OpenAPI

**TODO**

## Privacy and Security

The CloudDiscovery API does not place restrictions on producers choice of an
authentication and authorization mechanism. Discovery output MAY be different
for different principals.
