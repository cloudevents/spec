# CloudSubscriptions: Discovery - Version 0.1-rc01

## Abstract

CloudSubscriptions Discovery API is a vendor-neutral API specification for
determining what events an Event Producer has available, as well as how to
subscribe to those events.

## Status of this document

This is a working draft. Breaking changes could be made in the next minor
version.

## Overview

The goal of the CloudDiscovery API is to enable connections between consumers of
events and Event producers to facilitate the creation of a
CloudSubscription. Note that whether an Event producer is a single entity,
an aggregator/broker of multiple event producers, or an intermediary is an
implementation detail of the producer and does not change how an event
consumer interacts with a specification compliant producer.

Discovery allows for an event producer to
advertise the event types that are available, provide the necessary information
to consume that event (schema / delivery protocol options), and the necessary
information to create a subscription. The output of the API ought to be such
that tooling can be built where all possible event producers and types arenâ€™t
known in advance.

There are several discovery use cases to consider from the viewpoint of event
consumers.

1. What event sources are available, and what event types do they produce?
2. What event types are available, and from which event sources?

The second case becomes relevant if multiple sources support the same event
types. Use case 1 is likely the dominant use case. Given the example of a public
cloud provider where all producers produce events, there might be dozens of
sources (producer systems) and hundreds of event types. The discovery funnel of
producer first, then event types helps users navigate without having to see large
lists of event types. Both of these cases show the importance of using filters
in the discovery API to narrow down the selection of available events.

The CloudEvent `source` attribute is a potential cause of high fanout. For
example, consider a blob storage system where each directory constitutes a
distinct `source` attribute value. For this reason, the exact CloudEvents
`source` attribute value that might appear in a CloudEvent will not appear in
the Discovery API query result. Instead, a higher level classifier
(`service`) will be used to represent the abstract notion of the generic
event producer of those events - in the example case, the blob storage service
itself.

## Notations and Terminology

### Notational Conventions

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD",
"SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be
interpreted as described in [RFC 2119](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2119).

### Terminology

This specification defines the following terms:

#### Producer

The "producer" is a specific instance, process or device that creates the data
structure describing the CloudEvent.

#### Intermediary

An "intermediary" receives a message containing an event for the purpose of
forwarding it to the next receiver, which might be another intermediary or a
consumer. A typical task for an intermediary is to route the event to receivers
based on the information in the event context.

#### Source

The "source" is the context in which the occurrence happened. In a distributed
system it might consist of multiple Producers. If a source is not aware of
CloudEvents, an external producer creates the CloudEvent on behalf of the
source.

#### Service

A "service" represents the entity which manages one or more event "sources".
For example, an Object Store service might have a set of event sources
where each event source maps to a bucket.

#### Consumer

A "consumer" receives the event and acts upon it. It uses the context and data
to execute some logic, which might lead to the occurrence of new events.

#### Subscription

The request for events from an Event Producer system.

#### Event Subscriber

The entity managing the lifecycle of a Subscription on behalf of an Event
Consumer. In some instances this might be the same entity as the Event Consumer.

For example, a UI for connecting eventing producers to event consumers would
be considered an event subscriber and a target user of this API.

## API Specification

This API is specified as a REST API with well defined entities and relationships
between those entities.

To help explain the data model, the following non-normative pseudo yaml shows
its basic conceptual structure:

( `*` means zero or more, `+` means one or more, `?` means optional)

```
- services: *
  - service: [unique identifier for producer of the specified event types]
    description: [human string] ?
    uri: [URI reference for human documentation] ?
    specversion: [ce-speciversion value] ? (required?)
    subscriptionuri: [URI to which the Subscribe request will be sent]
    subscriptionconfig: *
    authscope: [string] ?  (explain)
    protocols: +
    - protocol: [string]
    types: *
    - type: [ce-type value]
      description: [human string] ?
      datacontenttype: [ce-datacontenttype value] ?
      dataschema: [ce-dataschema URI] ?
      dataschematype: [string per RFC 2046] ?
      dataschemacontent: [schema] ?
      dataschemacontent: 
      extensions: *
      - name: [CE context attribute name]
        type: [CE type string]
        spec: [URI to specification defining the extension] ?
```

An example:
```
- services:
  - service: example.com
    subscriptionuri: https://events.example.com
    protocols:
    - protocol: HTTP
    types:
    - type: com.example.widget.create
    - type: com.example.widget.delete
```

Note: the above is just a sample and implementations are free to use any
internal model they wish to store the data as long as they are compliant
with the wire format/API defined by this specification.

And some sample queries:

- `http://.../?service=example.com`
  - Shows entire data model for `example.com`

- `http://.../?type=com.example.widget.create`
  - Shows all Services that have `com.example.widget.create` as one of
    its `types`.
  - Does this show entire data model for all Services that have this
    `type` (meaning all of its types), or does it just show the type referenced
    in the query? I'm leaning towards all.

- `http://.../?protocol=HTTP&type=com.example.widget.create
  - Same as previous except only shows Services that also supports the
    `HTTP` subscription protocol.


Questions:
- does specifying the same attribute multiple times imply OR or AND? OR
- does specifying diffrent attributes imply OR or AND?  AND

### Entities in the API

1. `eventprovider`
2. `type`
3. `producer`

The `EventProvider` and `Type` entities form the basis of the directory and can
be used to build user experiences around discovery. The `Producer` entity is
keyed off of `{EventProvider.Name, Type.Name}` and provides the necessary
details to create a subscription for events of that `ce-type` from the selected
`EventProvider`.

### REST Paths

Each path in the REST API represents either represents a list (or search) over
and entity class, or the retrieval of an individual entity by name. Each of
these operations MUST be supported by compliant discovery providers.

#### `/providers?matching=[search term]`

Returns a list of all providers in the discovery system, optionally filtering on
a provided search term (`matching`).

  `provider` names. The parameter can match any portion of the provider name.
* Constraints:
  * OPTIONAL
  * If present, MUST be non-empty
* Examples:
  * `"storage"`
    * matches:
      * `"Awesome Cloud Storage"`
      * `"File storage system"`
      * `"storage Storage STORAGE"`

##### Returns

Upon successful processing, the response MUST be a JSON array of `provider`
entities.

#### `/providers/{name}`

Retrieves an individual provider entity by exact match on the `provider` name.

##### Returns

Upon successful processing, the response MUST be a JSON object that is a single
`provider` entity.

#### `/providers/{name}/types`

Retrieves the details about the types that are offered by the specified
`provider`.

##### Returns

Upon successful processing, the response MUST be a JSON array of `type` entity
objects.

#### `/types?matching=[search term]`

MUST return a list of all Types in the discovery system. If the matching query
parameter is specified then the returned list MUST only include Types that match
the search term value.

##### matching

* Type: `string`
* Description: Search term that provides case insensitive match against `type`
  names. The parameter can match any portion of the type name.
* Constraints:
  * OPTIONAL
  * If present, MUST be non-empty
* Examples:
  * `"com.storage.object"`
    * matches:
      * `"com.storage.object.create"`

#### `/types/{name}`

Retrieves an individual type entity by exact match on the `type` name. Type
names MUST conform to the [CloudEvents type](./spec.md#type)
attribute specification.

A `type` entity as a JSON object.

#### `/types/{name}/providers`

Retrieves the details about providers that offer the specified `type`.

##### Returns

A JSON array of `provider` entities.

#### `/producer/{provider.name}/{type.name}`

Retrieves the `producer` entity that specifies the information necessary to
create subscriptions and to consume the events. The `provider.name` and
`type.name` items in the request path make up the composite key for the
information that can be obtained via the `/provider` and `/type` API calls.

##### Returns

A `producer` entity as a JSON object.


## Protocol Bindings

The discovery API can be implemented over different API systems. We provide
API schema definitions for implementing this API using OpenAPI and gRPC as
illustrative examples.

### REST, JSON HTTP API

All responses will have a content-type of `application/json` and are either
a single JSON encoded object or an array of objects.

### OpenAPI

**TODO**

## Privacy and Security

The CloudDiscovery API does not place restrictions on producers choice of an
authentication and authorization mechanism. Discovery output MAY be different
for different principals.
