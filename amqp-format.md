# AMQP Event Format for CloudEvents

## Abstract

The AMQP Format for CloudEvents defines how event attributes are expressed in
the [AMQP 1.0 Type System][type-system].

## 1. Introduction

[CloudEvents][ce] is a standardized and transport-neutral definition of the
structure and metadata description of events. This specification defines how the
elements defined in the CloudEvents specification are to be represented in the
[AMQP 1.0 Type System][amqp-types].

The [Attributes](#2-attributes) section describes the naming conventions and
data type mappings for CloudEvents attributes for use as AMQP message
properties.

This specification does not define an envelope format. The AMQP type system's
intent is primarily to provide a consistent type system for AMQP itself and not
for message payloads.

### 1.1. Conformance

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD",
"SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be
interpreted as described in [RFC2119][rfc2119].

## 2. Attributes

This section defines how CloudEvents attributes are mapped to the AMQP
type-system. This specification does not explicitly map each attribute, but
provides a generic mapping model that applies to all current and future
CloudEvents attributes, including extensions.

### 2.1. Base Type System

The core [CloudEvents specification][ce] defines a minimal abstract type system,
which this mapping leans on.

### 2.2. Type System Mapping

The CloudEvents type system MUST be mapped to AMQP types as follows, with
exceptions noted below.

| CloudEvents   | AMQP                        |
| ------------- | --------------------------- |
| String        | [string][amqp-string]       |
| Integer       | [long][amqp-long]           |
| Binary        | [binary][amqp-binary]       |
| URI-reference | [string][amqp-string]       |
| Timestamp     | [timestamp][amqp-timestamp] |
| Map           | [map][amqp-map]             |
| Any           | See 2.3.                    |

A CloudEvents AMQP format implementation MUST allow for attribute values to be
convertible from/to their canonical CloudEvents string representation. For
instance, the `time` attribute MUST be convertible from and to a conformant
RFC3339 string value.

If an non-string attribute is received as string from a communicating party, an
AMQP intermediary MAY convert it to the native AMQP representation before
forwarding the event; an AMQP consumer SHOULD convert it to the native AMQP
representation before surfacing the value to the API. An AMQP implementation
SHOULD convert from/to the native runtime or language type system to the AMQP
type system directly without translating through strings whenever possible.

Extension specifications MAY define diverging mapping rules for the values of
attributes they define.

For instance, the attribute value may be a data structure defined in a standard
outside of CloudEvents, with a formal AMQP mapping, and there might be risk of
translation errors or information loss when the original format is not
preserved.

An extension specification that defines a diverging mapping rule for AMQP, and
any revision of such a specification, MUST also define explicit mapping rules
for all other event formats that are part of the CloudEvents core at the time of
the submission or revision.

### 2.3. Mapping Any-typed Attributes

`Any`-typed CloudEvents values can either hold a `String`, or a `Binary` value,
or a `Map`. `Map` entry values are also `Any` typed. AMQP's type system natively
represents dynamic typing in its [type system encoding][type-system-encoding],
and therefore immediately allows for the required variant type representation.
